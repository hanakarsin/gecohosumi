He noted that instead of resulting to such gestapo style of arrest, the DSS could have easily invited the man of God if they have anything against him:</p><p class=align-left><i>“If they have any issue with him instead of arresting him in the dead of the night after a powerful and spirit-filled crusade in my state.”</i></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Opinion: “Apostle” Johnson Suleiman: Please leave my God out of your “killing business”</p><p class=align-left>The governor said: “<i>I personally attended his crusade and I think it is wrong for a man of God who is armless that could be invited if they have any issue against him.

Let them kill two of us together.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“But when they saw my vehicles and the crowd, they fled. “But we have information that instructions came from DSS in Abuja that the Pastor should be arrested.We are not in a fascist state, Federal Government must learn to respect the rights of Nigerians and freedom of expression.”</i></p><p class=align-left>Going further, the governor said that harassment of clergymen is a dangerous trend in the country because religion is a volatile issue government should be wary of.</p><p class=align-left>He therefore call on security operatives against intimidation and arrest of men of God in the interest of peace and religious harmony in the country.</p><p class=align-left>He said: <i>“This is unacceptable, we are in a democracy and Nigerians should warn the Presidency against putting this country on fire because religion is an emotional thing.”</i></p><p class=align-left>View the video of the development below:</p><p class=align-left>Recall that a video recently emerged where the fiery senior pastor of the Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide, Apostle Johnson Suleman asked his church members to deal ruthlessly with any Fulani herdsman whose mission is to attack him or the church.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnGEk21pcWWWlsawv8Rmqq2noKh6pb%2FSZpirqpWowaq6xmaYqaejqbmmecmon6ern6N6tMHLnqSapl2auKrAyGanoaekpHq3tcOepmegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tope-alabi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tope Alabi News Today | Tope Alabi Daily Updates on Legit.ng</span></a>

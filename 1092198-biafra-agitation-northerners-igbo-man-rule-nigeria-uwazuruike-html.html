I tried again in 2003 and the same thing happened.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>”I therefore pray that the other people (Igbo) can take it up from there and make progress”</i>, Uwazuruike noted that Ekwueme failed to give Ndigbo any reason or assurance that the same treatment meted on him in successive elections would not be revisited on our younger generation.</p><p class=align-left>He recalled that the former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo did not hide his feeling how he thought the Igbo should be treated in the country when he visited Imo State during his first official outing as Head of State in 1978 and told them to thank their god for the generosity of the Nigerian leaders, for not lining them up for execution after the Nigeria – Biafra civil war which ended with no victor, no vanguished.</p><p class=align-left>The BIM/MASSOB leader reminded Ekwueme and Iwuanyanwu how their efforts to emerge as Presidential candidates of their various political parties were thwarted when two Igbo sons were sponsored by the Peoples Demoratic Party, PDP and All Peoples Party, APP to frustrate the chances of Ndigbo from producing a Presidential candidate.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Get the latest news on Legit.ng News App</p><p class=align-left>According to him, <i>“the anger which led me to demand the resuscitation of Biafra republic had to do with the soiled relationship between Ndigbo and the rest of Nigerians since the January 15, 1966 Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu-led military coup”.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“The Hausa/Fulani and Yoruba conspiracy against Ndigbo is real and that was why the former Defence Minister, Gen. Theophilus Danjuma (retd) could also not hide his own feeling and hatred for Ndigbo when he made an open declaration that he would go into exile than allowed Dr. Ekwueme to be President of Nigeria”.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Through MASSOB/BIM, the world has heard clearly the marginalized voice of the Igbo man which wasonly heard in quiet, grumbling and murmuring tone before I started the struggle for Biafra in 1999 and today, the world is waiting for the emergence of the new Biafra Nation”.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Through me, the world which probably thought that all was well with Ndigbo in Nigeria now knows the Prison wall of injustice the Igbo man is hemmed in Nigeria”.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“My observation is that if the American fathers of Independence who fought the British colonialism status quo in 1775, had allowed themselves to be derailed out of their vision through patronage and ‘settlement’, they would have died and their names forgotten few years afterwards</i>.<i>"</i></p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has accused south-east governors of frustrating the release of their leader Nnamdi Kanu.</p><p class=align-left>A zonal coordinator of IPOB, Emeka Mbamarah, who made the allegation in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, said the south-east governors had been sabotaging their agitation, Vanguard reports.</p><p class=align-left>Mbamarah however, maintained that the youths would continue with the Biafra struggle until Nnamdi Kanu is released.</p><p class=align-left>He said despite the non-interest of the governors in securing Kanu’s release, the IPOB leader would <i>non-interest of the governors in securing Kanu’s release, the IPOB leader would “surely come out with Biafra flag”</i></p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnGFkWpwcWWSnq6nvsBmmKChpJbBqrvNZqWoqqSdsrO6xKuqZqGXl7xuucCnZKutnJp6r7XGnqmimV2qxKLG1KusoqOVY7W1ucs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anne-jeffreys-html.html><span>←</span><span>Anne Jeffreys - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>

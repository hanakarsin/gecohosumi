This technically innovative and gorgeously polished form of bronze is art historians and anthropologists’ most favorite discursive topic.</p><p class=align-left>The earliest examples of cast bronze artifacts were found in Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria, in the 9th century. In West Africa, the tradition of bronze casting reached its peak during the Great kingdoms periods. The hardest cire perdue technique was used for the creation of different items made of bronze. The lost-wax casting technique is the process of duplicating metal sculpture ( silver, bronze or gold) from an original one.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt300q3qhev9sg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The history of Igbo language</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bronze casters organized some special formations and held a key position in the society. At that time, only a king was able to demand the production of bronze items and control the distribution of metal relics. The most popular bronze artifact was calabash bowl. It was commonly decorated with pyroengraved designs.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nigerian traditional art and culture</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt300q3qhev9sg.jpeg><h3>The Igbo-Ukwu town art</h3><p class=align-left>The Nigerian town Igbo-Ukwu is famous for its archaeological sites, where for the first time, bronze artifacts were found. The discovered items are examples of Nigerian refined bronze art. Igbo-Ukwu is located near the well-known modern town of Onitsha, which is in the southeast of Nigeria. Igbo-Ukwu is situated in Aguata Local Government Area, Anambra State. The town has a historical and cultural significance for Igbo and Nigerians as a whole. In the past, Igbo-Ukwu was part of the Nri Kingdom, (the 10th century AD).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt31rjbbmk8pcg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Igbo clothes and their meaning</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytib9cmg8645k.jpeg><p class=align-left>The prominent Igbo-Ukwu archaeological site has different parts, including the main burial place with caches and shrines. Archaeological experts discovered the site in 1939 when an Igbo farmer named Isaiah Anozie accidentally stumble upon several bronze objects. He was digging the soil to hold water in the dry seasons and never thought he could find something so precious in his yard. In 1959, archaeologist Alice Apley started to study more about local Igbo-Ukwu population and their culture.</p><p class=align-left>She talks a bit about the art of the locals, saying:<i>" The inhabitants of Igbo-Ukwu had a metalworking art that flourished as early as the ninth century. Three sites have been excavated, revealing hundreds of ritual vessels and regalia castings of bronze or leaded bronze that are among the most inventive and technically accomplished bronzes ever made.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt31rjbbmk8pcg.jpeg><p class=align-left>Alice Apley also stated that Igbo-Ukwu people were the earliest coppersmiths in West Africa. They started to work with metal by bending, twisting and incising it. They are considered to be the earliest groups of West Africans who used casting techniques to produce bronze sculptures. Although they were not familiar with soldering, riveting and raising metal techniques, they managed to make fine bronze items.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt4vajtrmvqcg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 best historical places in Nigeria</span></p></a><h3>6 Top interesting facts about Igbo-Ukwu bronze art</h3><ul><li>Almost all of Igbo Ukwu bronze art objects were made around the 9th century AD.

It is undoubtedly the earliest type of art in Nigeria and the first one to set on trade. Looking at all these interesting ornaments and patterns makes you wonder at how a person can express is/her own perception of the world in art. The bronze seems to be perfect material at all times.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Igbo cultural dance attire</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnJ%2BlXBpcmWYnsC1u9GyZKKfkqR6trfWrmSaqqRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1150359-governor-edo-state-biography-wife-html.html><span>←</span><span>Governor of Edo State biography and wife</span></a>

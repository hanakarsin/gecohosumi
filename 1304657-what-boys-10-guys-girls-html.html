Sincerely, what boys like about girls vary, but there are some common things that they look for in girls.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03e7864af68d2c60.jpg><p class=align-left>There might be a long list of what guys want in a girl, but in this one, we narrow down to the most important ones that seem to cut across the preferences of all men. So, if you are craving for guys’ attention, pay attention and learn a few handy tips.</p><h2>What do guys want in a girl?</h2><p class=align-left>What boys like in girls do not have anything to do with sophistication, but simplicity. As you will find out, it is the simple things that count when it comes to what guys want in a girlfriend.</p><h3>1. Always wear a smiling face</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dde887a930a42f35.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best tips on how to get a boyfriend</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dde887a930a42f35.jpeg><p class=align-left>It might seem simple and less effective, but a smile brightens up your face. It shows that you are in good moods and easily approachable.</p><p class=align-left>Smiling not only enhances your appearance, but it also goes a long way in making a guy feel comfortable around you. So, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">put on a smile</a>, be jovial, and you will get that attention you deserve from men.</p><h3>2. Laughing</h3><p class=align-left>This goes hand in hand with smiling. If you do not smile or laugh, you will put off any guy who might be interested in you.</p><p class=align-left>Laugh whenever necessary but do it reasonably and genuinely. During your first conversation with a guy, he is likely to be humorous, and that does not mean that you laugh at every joke he makes.</p><p class=align-left>Laughing quells tension between the two of you, and it is the best way to connect if you are just starting to know each other.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best tips on how to get a girlfriend</span></p></a><h3>3. Intelligence</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/50fa58a5e3d601c7.jpg><p class=align-left>What boys like in girls sometimes goes beyond physical appearance. For guys, a woman’s intellectual capacity is an essential consideration.</p><p class=align-left>Can you talk and reason logically? Every guy wants a woman who can hold meaningful conversations and one who will not just keep mum while the guy does the talking.</p><p class=align-left>Conversation is a critical aspect of every relationship as it is the basis on which you can get to understand your partner better.</p><h3>4. Honesty and confidence</h3><p class=align-left>Honesty builds trust in relationships, and that is another important thing men look for in women. Do not be shy to tell a man how you feel about him or a particular situation.</p><p class=align-left>You must not necessarily tell him all the details but speak out your mind to let him know your opinion.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, what guys want in women is confidence. Always stand up for what you believe in as that defines your character. A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">self-confident woman</a> knows her self-worth, and she will likely draw men close to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6987260bd8a31e42.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top things to talk about with a girl you like</span></p></a><h3>5. Natural beauty</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpg><p class=align-left>Makeup will significantly enhance your appearance and make you easily noticeable. However, you should not overdo it such that it seems that you depend on makeup solely to make you beautiful.</p><p class=align-left>Makeup can be quite deceiving more so when used to conceal some aspects of the body. Men have become quite cautious, and they prefer women in their natural skin. Start appreciating your natural appearance, and you will attract men.</p><h3>6. Self-reliance</h3><p class=align-left>Do not over-rely on a guy to the extent that you become clingy and bothersome. In such a scenario, a man will opt to stay away from a woman who excessively depends on him.</p><p class=align-left>Find a way of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">taking care of yourself</a> and your needs so that you give the man some space. By showing that you do not really need him in everything, you make him want you more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9e941178f115bcdc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to win a man's heart in easy steps</span></p></a><h3>7. Fragrance</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/88a88ef890f8d01f.jpg><p class=align-left>Maybe you did not know about this, but your scent can be a miracle worker if you want to attract a guy. Wear unique perfume with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pleasant fragrance</a> that will always announce your presence when you are around him.</p><p class=align-left>Such a scent can stimulate lots of emotions within him that makes him attracted to you. The fragrance reminds him of you even if the smell comes from someone else.</p><h3>8. Femininity</h3><p class=align-left>You could opt to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">maintain a feminine look</a>, and that does not mean that you will look weak. Express your femininity by how you dress as well as how you carry out yourself and lots of men will want to associate themselves with you.</p><h3>9. Love</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6987260bd8a31e42.jpg><p class=align-left>Everyone needs love but are you ready to love?

By showing love and respect, you look lovable</p><h3>10. Manners</h3><p class=align-left>Men try as much as possible to avoid any instances of embarrassment, especially in public places.

They help teach kids the difference between right and wrong.</p><p class=align-left>They are beliefs, ideas, and principles that are specific to your home and how it functions.

Moral values are the foundation from which you make decisions. Morals are learned from your parents, schools, your experiences, e.t.c.</p><h3>Recreational values</h3><p class=align-left>Recreational values refer to anything that involves fun and play.

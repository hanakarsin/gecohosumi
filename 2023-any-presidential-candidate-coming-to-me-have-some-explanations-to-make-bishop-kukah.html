We need to re-image and re-imagine Nigeria because the Nigeria that we have today is not the Nigeria that many of us can recognize.”</p><h2>My Nephew And His Driver Are Still In Kidnapper’s Den</h2><p>Speaking further at the event, Bishop Kukah expressed displeasure on the spate of insecurity in Nigeria. The cleric said he has paid about N30 million as a ransom for the release of his church priests who had been victims of kidnappers in the past.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Kukah made the shocking revelation in the one-day programme tagged: “High-level forum on political communication and issue-based campaign in the 2023 general elections.”</p><p>He said: “Before coming here, I was speaking with my brother, because two days ago, my nephew, his mother, and the driver were on their way to Abuja when they ran into the hands of kidnappers. My brother’s wife had an amputation some three months ago and they were bringing her to Abuja, so when the kidnappers saw the stomp on her leg, they had mercy on her and let her go.</p><p>“Right now, as we speak, my nephew and the driver of the vehicle are currently in the hands of the kidnappers, how it is going to end? I don’t know. Then they said they wanted N50m, they then said they wanted N20m, now they are staying on N30m.”</p><p>Speaking about the payment of ransom totalling N30 million to rescue the priests in his diocese from the hands of kidnappers, the cleric said he was not ashamed to share the information.</p><p>“I am the Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, I have spent about N30m the money I don’t have because my priests were kidnapped and I have nowhere to turn to.</p><p>“I am not ashamed to say it because these are essential realities. Anyone who wants to become president of Nigeria cannot pretend to stand before me without giving me empirical evidence from his or her record about how they intend to deal with these issues because there is a collective feeling of alienation.</p><p>“Here in Abuja, just about a month or so, when the threats came that the bandits will enter into Abuja, everybody went undercover,”&nbsp;the Bishop said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5ByZmtoYmh6orrYZqernaOesaa606KYpWWTlrultcOaq55lk6S6qrrGZquoZZ2aeqmt1Z5krKedmnqmxM%2BlmKeZpJ68r7%2BMraZmpZGgsm6uyKyfqKhdoMKsrcdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./popsinger-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pop Singers | Famous Birthdays</span></a>

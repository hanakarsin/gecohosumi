But a young man of his( Saraki) status who knows the country well should lead the country for maximum results.</p><p>“Am glad to have found people who have defined who a true Nigerian leader should be. This definition was lacking. Am happy you have identified someone who can do the job. The narrative has to change. I know your client very well. I am part of him. His father was very close to me.</p><p>“You have zeroed on a good candidate. I call him SP. In the artillery, we have a Self Propelled gun called SP with strategic responsibility and functions. That is who he is”.</p><p>Babangida commended Saraki for his wisdom which he said saved the country from the imminent crisis that ensued during his reign as Senate President.</p><p>IBB expressed the belief that the former governor has the capacity to unite the country and bring back the rich diversities of different tribes.</p><p>He said:” It was Saraki’s efforts that saved the nation from the imminent crisis that ensued.</p><p>“Remember if he was not able to nip the crisis, only God knows what would have happened. It was his intelligence at play that saved the nation. He is the best for Nigeria.</p><p>“But a lot of work must be done to convince colleagues and Nigerians to this. You have identified the right person for the leadership of this country.</p><p>“We need a leader that can utilise our rich diversities to our advantage.

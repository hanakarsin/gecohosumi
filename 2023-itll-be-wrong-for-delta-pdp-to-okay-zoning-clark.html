That is how it should be done.</p><p>“After Delta Central senatorial district, it will come to this or after Delta South senatorial district, it will come to this and after Delta North senatorial district, it will come to that. Or you can say, okay, like osusu (traditional money collection system), now that we have finished this round, let the North start. It does not mean that if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa goes, it cannot start from the North again. If it is by osusu way that is way it should happen?”</p><p>Clerk questioned further saying: “Was there any meeting when it was decided that Urhobos should start the rotation on senatorial basis or Urhobos are using their majority in the PDP caucus and knowledge to want to impose their wish on other Deltans?”</p><p>“If it is so, what are we in the South-South part of the country generally fighting the North for? We are saying that they cannot use their population and education to oppress the minority.</p><p>“What the Ijaws are saying is that we are in minority, our area is peculiar to other areas. The Urhobos have only the Urhobos in Delta Central, the Aniomas have only the Igbo-speaking people in Delta North, but in Delta South, you have the Isokos, the Ijaws and the Itsekiris and for anybody to say that you cannot zone, according to ethnicity, can you do anything in Delta state without saying that you are doing it on ethnicity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FsZmtoYmh6qsDLpWSbnV2sv7C6xmadqKpdmbKtwMBmp52oXam8brvKmrBmsp%2Bjtq%2BzjJyjmqqbZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./four-media-houses-under-lock-in-zamfara-for-covering-pdp-rally.html><span>←</span><span>Four Media Houses Under Lock In Zamfara For Covering PDP Rally</span></a>

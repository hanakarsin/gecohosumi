Specifically, a northern governor cautioned against any move that would deny any party member the chance to seek the ticket.</p><p>“But pro-zoning governors insisted on the need for the PDP to respect its unwritten formula on rotational presidency, saying it is the turn of the south to rule the country come 2023.</p><p>“The governors parted without taking a decision on the matter at the meeting, and I can tell you that this has polarised the governors further.</p><p>“Party leaders and chieftains are worried about the development and not a few of our governors have been discussing it.”</p><p>Another source said some governors, after another parley, decided to approach Jonathan and Atiku as well as Governors Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, former Kano State governor Rabiu Musa Kwakwanso, among others, to get their positions on the zoning debate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze49vZmtoYmh6sbDPZp6orpWnu7C%2B0marqGWdmrK1ecmopZqsmJa7bq3ToqKuZZusrq%2B31pqqqGWfqbWmvtJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-does-elyse-leave-the-bachelor.html><span>←</span><span>Why Does Elyse Leave 'The Bachelor'?

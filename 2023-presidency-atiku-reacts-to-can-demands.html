These are our plans to tackle the security challenges facing the country.</p><p>“For sure we need a judicial amendment. First of all, there are poor wages for judges and very poor working conditions. Again, the judiciary has levels, the federal judiciary, and state, but we will attempt as much as possible to have a judicial reform where we will improve the dispensation of justice and also the welfare of Judges.</p><p>“I am a supporter of the removal of the clause of the definition of indigeneship in our constitution; once you reside in any part of the country, and you pay your taxes, you should be entitled to indigeneship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FsZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6t06KirmWimq6kwNJmq6hlk5a7brDEppinnKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nigeria-is-not-a-working-democracy-we-dont-have-a-political-party-in-nigeria-today-pat-utomi.html><span>←</span><span>'Nigeria Is Not A Working Democracy, We Don't Have A Political Party In Nigeria Today'</span></a>

Peter won’t affect APC’s votes. The votes he will likely get are votes that would have gone to PDP, including SE, some non Yoruba Lagos votes, and a few votes in peripheral states.</p><p>“Tinubu is a master tactician. He knows Peter Obi cannot win. He knows that very little of Peter’s votes, if any at all, will come from him. He is aware that Peter is eating into the PDP’s votes. So, he will promote Obi’s candidacy through proxies to deplete the PDP.”</p><p>A chieftain of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), <strong>Buba Galadima,</strong> has said talks of an alliance between his party’s presidential candidate, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, and the candidate of the Labour Party may be reignited.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Obi and Kwankwaso could not come to an agreement when they had held talks about allying ahead of the 2023 election.</p><p>It was gathered that the duo could not agree on who should drop his presidential ambition and settle for the running mate ticket.</p><p>Speaking to Daily Independent, Galadima said there could be another chance for both parties to discuss about forming an alliance before next year’s election.</p><p>He, however, expressed disappointment that the NNPP could not seal a deal with the Labour Party.</p><p>According to him, If an alliance is sealed, next year’s election would have been won by noon.</p><p>Asked if he was disappointed about the outcome of the failed talks, Buba Galadima said: “You know I chaired that meeting. Yes, definitely. I was disappointed that it didn’t happen.</p><p>“If that union had taken place, the election of Nigeria on February 25, 2023 would have ended by 12pm. In fact, some of us would have been in Dubai or Paris dining when we would be told that we have won the election.</p><p>“But you know, ego would be what I considered to be part of the issues. And people think that what we say in the press is what happens in actual life.</p><p>“I don’t want to go into it because there could still be another chance for us to talk to each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FtZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm67zKiiq6Fdlrmtscaeqmagn6x6tbXNrpmuZZmoera%2FyKeeZqiVqbKzec6boGaZl5a2r7%2FTZpitoZuqfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-house-of-reps-confirms-service-chiefs-appointment.html><span>←</span><span>House Of Reps Confirms Service Chiefs Appointment</span></a>

He even denied the ownership of Alpha Beta. The only two things he admitted he runs are The Nation newspaper and TVC. So, we are talking about [Tinubu] a billionaire without an enterprise and [Atiku] a billionaire with an enterprise who has succeeded, who is a major employer of labour in this country.</p><p>“Over the years, he has managed the businesses into successes and these businesses have grown to become intercontinental. Atiku understands the dynamics of the economy. He understands the private sector. He understands what liberalisation of our economy will bring for us. He understands what the privatisation of our economy will bring for us.</p><p>“He understands the role of the private sector in the modern-day economy. He knows the pros and cons of the economy. Now, he has gone to garnish his knowledge with Masters in International Relations and Diplomacy from a university in Cambridge. He has updated his education. Has Tinubu gone back to school since he left school 30-40 years ago?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49sZmtoYmh6tbXNrpmuZZmoeqJ5waKjpaGfo66qvsRmrqKsmKTCtXnAZpmuq5mjsrS%2FjJ2gp6ddorKtrdieZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./victoria-vida-html.html><span>←</span><span>Victoria Vida - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

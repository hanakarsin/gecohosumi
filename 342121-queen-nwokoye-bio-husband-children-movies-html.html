Her parents were devout Catholics, and thus she was brought up in a strict Catholic background. On top of that, her mother and grandparents were teachers. This led to a strict upbringing, where most of her early life revolved around school and church. As a result, she ended up being a very reserved and shy teenager.</p><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, Queen has stated that it was due to this upbringing that she learned to become disciplined and determined. Besides, being born into a large family, she enjoyed the company of her siblings, especially her sisters who she would play with.</p><h2>Education</h2><p class=align-left>Queen, being an actress is not just a pretty face.

The first one was her role as Ada Mbano, in a 2014 film under the same name. The film was well-received by Nollywood fans across the world, and she received an Africa Movie Academy Awards nomination for her performance. It was one of her most challenging role yet in the industry, as she had to study and speak the Imo State dialect.</p><p class=align-left>The second role that brought her to limelight was <i>Chetanna,</i> a 2014 hit film in which Queen was a lead actress, and which was screened in the 2014 World Igbo Festival of Arts in the U.S. It is through this movie that she gained widespread international recognition.</p><p class=align-left>Since then, Queen has gone on to feature in several other films such as <i>Blind Bartimus</i> (2015), <i>Agaracha</i> (2016), and <i>New Educated Housewife</i> (2017).

Like most celebrities, Nwokoye is very private about her personal life, and with good reason. Celebrities, especially in Nollywood&lt; are usually a target of media, fans, and critics, which is why she closely guards her personal life. However, from time to time, details about her have emerged. Here is a look at some of them:</p><h3>Queen Nwokoye parents</h3><p class=align-left>Not much is known about her parents other than the fact that they were strict disciplinarians and were staunch Catholics who brought up her in strict Catholic background. On top of that, Queen Nwokoye’s mother was a teacher and strongly believed against wasting time, and instead of putting it to good use.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Anthony Joshua bio, height, records, girlfriend, son, and parents</p><p class=align-left>In 2019, Queen Nwokoye lost her father and mother, their deaths <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">within six months</a> of each other.

However, the tragedy did not dim her star, a testament to her strong personality.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8a82a39866f6cc8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Khatira Rafiqzada: nationality, net worth, kids, parents, Michael Ealy relationship</span></p></a><h3>Queen Nwokoye siblings</h3><p class=align-left>Not much is known about her siblings, other than the fact that she has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">six siblings</a>, three sisters, and three brothers. Due to the strict religious lifestyle of her parents, Queen was only left to interact and play with her sisters.</p><h3>Queen Nwokoye husband</h3><p class=align-left>Is Queen Nwokoye the actress married? And if so, who is the husband of Queen Nwokoye? With how Nwokoye keeps her life private, many people don’t know whether she is married or not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg><p class=align-left>Queen Nwokoye is married to her husband, Oluchi Uzoma. The couple tied the knot in a secret ceremony, which she stated was in an effort to prevent a media circus during the wedding.</p><p class=align-left>Uzoma is a successful businessman who hails from Imo State and is based in South Africa. In 2019, he<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> joined politics</a>, where he ran for a seat in the Imo State House of Assembly.

The first two are twin boys, while the third is a girl whom the couple welcomed later on. Just like with other aspects of her personal life, Nwokoye keeps her family private, with only very few pictures of her children shared on the internet.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Wondering how rich Nwokoye is? With over 250 movie roles to her name and her international recognition, Queen is one of the most successful actresses in Nollywood. However, she is one of the few down to earth celebrities<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> who don’t enjoy</a> flaunting their wealth.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, the current Queen Nwokoye net worth is only estimated to be around $100,000 to $1,000,000. However, given her recent success plus her marriage to her successful business mogul of husband, you shouldn’t be surprised if you learn that it is much more than that.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/39798204969ee7d7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yvonne Okwara biography: Age, tribe, husband, house, background</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Ini Edo's biography: kids, husband, and family</p><h2>Queen Nwokoye house and cars</h2><p class=align-left>It’s not surprising that not much is known about Nwokoye’s house and cars. However, the few photos she has shared with her family show her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">living in a nice house</a>, probably in Lagos. As for cars, a photo of her with her daughter, which she shared on social media showed her standing next to a Prado TX.</p><h2>Awards and recognition</h2><p class=align-left>Queen Nwokoye’s career has been very successful, and she is considered to be one of the most prominent Nollywood actresses.

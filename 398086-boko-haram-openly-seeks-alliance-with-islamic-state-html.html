Mohammed Shekau the Imam of Jama'atu Ahlus Sunnah Lidda Awati Wal Jihad&nbsp;to the Caliph of Muslims Abubakar Abu Bakr Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi,</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"We are sending you this message, following what Allah said in his Quran:&nbsp;(and hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah and be not divided among yourselves)</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"And what the Prophet peace be upon him said: (Whoever died and he had not Imam, died by death of ignorance).</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"In submission to the order of Allah "Azza wa Jal", and submission to the order of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to not separate from each other and to stay united as Ummah as Jamma'ah,</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"We announce our allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity,&nbsp;in hardship and ease, and to endure being discriminated against, and not to dispute about rule with those in power, except in case of evident infidelity regarding that which there is a proof from Allah.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"We call on Muslims everywhere to pledge allegiance to the Caliph and support him, as obedience to Allah as their application of the absent duty of the era, we pledged allegiance to the Caliph because of the Interest of the Ummah in their religion and in their Dunya is to have an Imam that looks after them according to the Allah's Rule and fights the enemy of Islam and those who fights the Rule of Allah and this is the completeness of the religion with the book that guides and the Sword that favors.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: (People must know that having to rule the people is one of the greatest duties of the Religion, even the religion and the world for Muslims will never be in complete without it, the interest of Sons of Adam won't be successful without them being united under one Jamma'ah after their gathering together they must have a head, and it's not a problem even if the less of the groups who oppose the others unite for this cause...)</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"We pledge allegiance because there is no cure of the dissimilarity that Ummah have except the Caliphate, we also call all the Muslims to join in this goodness, because it would enrage the enemy of Allah, by Allah, our gathering under one banner, under one Imam is more heavy to the enemy morality than for them ..."</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"Allahu Akbar (God is great),&nbsp;Allahu Akbar,&nbsp;Allahu Akbar!</i></p><p class=align-left><i>"And to Allah belongs (all) honour, and to His Messenger, and

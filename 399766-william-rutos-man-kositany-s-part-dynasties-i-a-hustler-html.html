It is about showing the motivation behind those who have worked hard despite hailing from humble backgrounds and to indicate that one can rise to a higher position regardless of where they come from," he insisted."Willia Ruto for instance is being referred to as the 'chief hustler' because he rose from a chicken seller to being the deputy president who occupies the second highest office in the land. So he believes that people at the ground level engaging different businesses also have a chance to ascend to higher positions like him," he added.<h3>Uhuru angered by hustler vs dynasty debate</h3><p class=align-left>President Uhuru Kenyatta had been <a href=#>enraged </a>by the hustler versus dynasty debate ongoing across the country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4a35bd5ae5a50a48.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi: Burma residents heckle Raila, chant in support of Ruto, wheelbarrows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The head of state said the presidency does not belong to two tribes as he aimed a jibe at his deputy Ruto's team.</p>"There are many communities in Kenya…let us stop dividing Kenyans based on these hustler versus dynasty talk...Let us respect one another…if that is the rationale, then I can also say that there are only two tribes that have occupied the top seat, perhaps it is time for another community to lead...we want a strong and united Kenya," he spoke during the funeral of Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi's mother in Vihiga.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?

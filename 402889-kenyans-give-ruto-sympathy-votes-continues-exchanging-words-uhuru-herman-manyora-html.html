Never miss important updates.</p><p class=align-left>Political commentator Herman Manyora has said Deputy President William Ruto will miss the benefit of sympathy votes if he continues engaging in verbal exchanges with his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/428805fcb79df715.jpeg><p class=align-left>Manyora, in his latest edition of analysis of developments in the Jubilee administration and 2022 succession politics, said Ruto had an advantage of receiving sympathy votes from Kenyans if impeached or continued to play the victim card.</p><p class=align-left>According to the political critic, voters would most likely throw their weight behind Ruto if they feel" he is unfairly treated by Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga". However, his decision to tackle the duo head-on "make voters assume that he has the muscle to fight".</p>"It has been argued that if you impeach Ruto, you will be giving him mileage. Why? Because of the sympathy card. However, impeachment is on the cards and it is very possible because if Uhuru and Raila decide to look for numbers, they will find them. That sympathy is gone because Uhuru has come out in the open fighting and hitting at Ruto.Ruto will start hitting back as he has been doing recently. The moment he begins hitting back, he will be falling into the trap set by Uhuru. Ruto is reacting. Uhuru is drawing him into the ring. The moment he enters the ring, it means he is as much a fighter as Uhuru and Raila, and therefore when he is floored, there will be no sympathy. Ruto is doing exactly what Uhuru wants him to do. He will be punched. When impeachment will come, there will be no sympathy for him," said Manyora.<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Help us change more lives, join TUKO.co.ke’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon programme.</a></p><p class=align-left>Manyora, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi (UoN), was commenting on the recent exchanges between Uhuru and Ruto, which paint a picture of a divided Jubilee administration.</p><p class=align-left>As separately reported by <strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong>, <a href=#>Uhuru tore into Ruto's wheelbarrows narrative</a> and told the DP the youths "want jobs and not wheelbarrows".</p><p class=align-left>Last week, the president took issue with Ruto for criticising the government and at the same time taking credit for the good things it (government) has done.

Never miss important updates.</p><p class=align-left>In a bid to secure support in the vote-rich Mt Kenya region, Deputy President William Ruto has been dangling the running mate carrot to the region’s politicians, among them, sitting MPs and governors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/35b73a56a9060759.jpeg><p class=align-left>In the 2017 election, the region, which comprises Kiambu, Murang’a, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu, Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties, boasted of 5.3 million votes which translated to 31% of the 19.6 million registered voters.</p><p class=align-left>Add the vote-rich Mt Kenya diaspora counties of Nakuru, Laikipia and Nyandarua, and to an extent, Nairobi, and you will understand why the allure of the Gikuyu nation is irresistible in the race for the country’s top office.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Help us change more lives, join TUKO.co.ke’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon programme</a>.</p><p class=align-left>It is a voting bloc that every single candidate eyeing to replace President Uhuru Kenyatta, when his second and final term comes to a close, has been salivating at; one they feel they can’t do without.</p><p class=align-left>This is especially so for Ruto, who has in recent years invested heavily to sustain the “tyranny of numbers” that propelled him and Uhuru to power in 2013 and secured them a second term in 2017.</p><p class=align-left>But with the region finding itself without a strong candidate for the State House race for the first time since 1992, political suitors have been falling over themselves by promising to ensure the country’s second most coveted job goes there.</p><p class=align-left>Historically, the Mt Kenya region has largely played a pivotal role in shaping Kenya’s political destiny, and there is little doubt that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future regardless of whether it has a presidential candidate or not.</p><p class=align-left>So far, several names from the larger Mt Kenya region have been fronted as Ruto’s potential running mates.</p><p class=align-left>They include Murang’a governor Mwangi wa Iria, former Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, Meru senator Mithika Linturi, Tharaka Nithi senator Kindiki Kithure, Nakuru senator Susan Kihika, Laikipia Women Representative Cate Waruguru, Kirinyaga Women Representative Purity Ngirici, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and Kandara MP Alice Wahome.</p><p class=align-left>While wa Iria was initially a key insider in Ruto’s circles, he is today pursuing his own path and even harbours presidential ambitions of his own.</p><p class=align-left>Karua, who like Ruto’s lieutenants is opposed to BBI, is as unpredictable as they come. She is the iron lady best known for walking away from two sitting presidents and resigning from the Cabinet.</p><p class=align-left>She also harbours presidential ambitions but her chances of clinching the top seat have dwindled in recent years.</p><p class=align-left>Kiunjuri has in recent weeks stepped up campaigns to be Ruto’s running mate but he is unlikely to sway the region given that the Gikuyu nation has historically never politically embraced those outside central Kenya.</p><p class=align-left>The same applies to Kindiki, Linturi and Kihika. On their part, the likes of Kuria, Wahome and Ngirici and Ichung’wa lack political heft and the least said about them the better.</p><p class=align-left>To complicate matters for <a href=#>Ruto</a>, he has previously promised to name a female running mate. Yet, when it comes to Mt Kenya, Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru, the person who perhaps ticks all the boxes and previously seen as his ally, has since thrown her lot behind the handshake deal.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong>Don't miss trending Kenyan news. Follow <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TUKO.co.ke on Twitter</a>!</p><p class=align-left>She is now considered one of the possible beneficiaries of the expanded national executive envisaged under the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) that would see the return of a prime minister and two deputies if the proposed constitutional amendments are endorsed at the referendum.</p><p class=align-left>Like Waiguru, others who could have made ideal running mate choices for the DP from the Mt Kenya region are in Uhuru’s corner.</p><p class=align-left>They include National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, his Agriculture counterpart Peter Munya, Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi and former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth.</p><p class=align-left>Some think Ruto might cast his net wider in his search for a running mate to the Lower Eastern, Coast, Western and Upper Eastern regions by going for Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Machakos governor Alfred Mutua and former National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, among others.</p><p class=align-left>However, such a move will heavily erode any gains he has made in Mt Kenya where even those who back him are likely to troop to Uhuru’s corner.</p><p class=align-left>It is a fact of history that the Mt Kenya region puts its interests before anything else, and 2022 will not be any different. They will be keen on playing a leading role in Uhuru succession to secure their present and future.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a href=#>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB Feed</a></p><p class=align-left>Besides, it is also likely to be a tall order for Ruto as the <a href=#>BBI bandwagon</a> has already welcomed the most formidable politicians in all regions, including presidential contenders such as Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi.</p><p class=align-left>In Fred Matiang’i, Chris Obure, James Ongwae and Sam Ongeri, one can comfortably say the Gusii Nation is “locked”, with the same applying to Wycliffe Oparanya in Western.</p><p class=align-left>But the same cannot be said of the coast where second-time governors Hassan Joho and Amason Kingi are seemingly testing the waters and threatening to quit ODM and form a unifying coastal party.</p><p class=align-left>They appear more like free agents waiting for that all-important phone call. But are they really Ruto’s type?</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish? Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690.

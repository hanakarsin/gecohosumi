If elections were held today I would vote for him," Manyora said.<h2>Unfair attacks</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>University of Nairobi</a> don said Ruto was being attacked unfairly and corruption allegations labelled against him without his side of the story being heard. He claimed Kenya is a country of thieves.</p>"It doesn't help. This is a country of thieves. If you call someone a thief, how does it help you?"

Don't call Ruto a thief because all Kenyans' are thieves. So you are gaining nothing from it. In fact when you call him a thief, they say he is our thief," he said.<h2>Manyora's previous stance</h2><p class=align-left>In April, Manyora had claimed Ruto was <a href=#>losing political relevance</a> owing to the humiliations treated to his camp by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his team.</p><p class=align-left>He likened Ruto's way of politicking to Usain Bolts sprints, insinuating the DP's kind of <a href=#>politics</a> does not have the capacity of standing the test of time.</p><p class=align-left>The analyst had foreseen the DP becoming a deserted man by 2022 after some instances where his foot soldiers walked out on him.</p><p class=align-left>In February, the analyst had predicted Raila would be a <a href=#>transitional president </a>before paving way for Kanu's Gideon Moi.</p>"Gideon Moi is a prince.

Raila will be president until 2027 as Gideon is being processed. He will not fight for it. He will come in in more to the same way Uhuru himself came in. Moi was not defeated in 2002. Moi's game plan was to process Uhuru...Kibaki was stepping in," said Manyora.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?

I could not walk her to her door. I had to wait across the street every time. It pissed me off. That was back in the 70s and i hope things have changed now. They now accept me.. They both have crossed over now. Passed away. I wish I could have spent more time with them."<p class=align-left>Mike Bertolini remarked:</p>"My response would be that she is dating a fine young man, period. We no longer need to put labels on people. That is my personal perspective, agree with it or not. My perspective is from a life in Canada."<p class=align-left>Cheryl Hickman reacted:</p>"Why does it matter who people fall in love with? respect, happiness, compatibility and compassion show be the only things that matter.

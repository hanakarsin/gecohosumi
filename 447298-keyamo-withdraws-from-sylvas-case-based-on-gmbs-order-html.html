The court ruled in our favour for the trial to commence and the Court of Appeal also refused to stay proceedings in the trial.</i></p><p><i>“However, certain recent developments (in respect of which I would prefer not to elaborate) have necessitated my decision to withdraw from further prosecution of the said Charge. This is because these recent developments may hamper my effective, efficient and vigorous prosecution of the Charge, duties that are expected of every prosecutor.”</i></p><p>Meanwhile, an inside source in the APC, who spoke to Breaking Times on condition of anonymity, disclosed that it was the President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, who ordered Keyamo to stay off the case.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Nigerians React To Buhari-Diezani Trip To London</a></p><p>Sylva is the chairman of the Buhari May 29 transition committee and Keyamo is believed to be a confidant of Buhari on legal matters.</p><p>According to the source, with Keyamo’s involvement in the case as prosecuting counsel, Sylva would not escape conviction.</p><p><i>“Timipre actually begged Buhari to soften the grounds for him as his conviction would do more damage that Buhari will not recover from,”</i>&nbsp; the source added.</p><p>Sylva's trial had been fixed for Monday.

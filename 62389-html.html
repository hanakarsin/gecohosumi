This is unacceptable. We fear coming to school because not a single day goes by without him hitting us.”</p><p>When the 18-year-old girl was contacted on phone by a reporter, she only confirmed that she was at a clinic before hanging up.</p><p>However, when the accused teacher was telephoned later for comment, he denied the claims.</p><p>“You can write whatever you like because you want to sell the paper at my expense,” he said. “I have never beaten any child at the school.

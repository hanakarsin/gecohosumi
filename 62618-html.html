It is not because Clarence is successful today. Clarence knows the truth and those who are close to me know the truth. I didn’t have Clarence because I was too helpless to get rid of his pregnancy. I had three sets of friends: there was Dr. Ojikutu. When I was in the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University), he was ready to do it, free of charge. There was St. Lawrence in Ibadan and St. Jude here in Lagos.</i></p><p id=yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395517813518_15183><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p id=yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395517813518_15185><i>But each time, I said no. I lost my father when I was 11 and he left a message that he was going to come back to me through my first kid.</i></p><p><i>So, when I got pregnant, it kept ringing in my head that my father was coming back to me. Even my ex- husband knew how much my father meant to me. It was on his 30th anniversary that I was able to let go of the hurt of his death. Having Clarence was deliberate. I just had the conviction that my father was coming back. And from when he was born, everyone calls him daddy, including my mum."</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3OCkHFloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./al-sharpton-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Al Sharpton's Work as an Activist Has Always Come Before Personal Relationships</span></a>

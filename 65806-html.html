Where are the allowances?
Olukolade tagged as untrue reports that soldiers’ allowances have been cut from N30,000 to N15,000, added that no one is stealing their money and, in fact, nobody can do it because of the current system of checks."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He urged journalists to ignore unconfirmed words of soldiers, and the military men to be patient if a delay occurs.</p><p><strong>Exhausted by the North East</strong></p><p>The DHQ official further reacted on another complaint: the tour of duty. The soldiers lamented that some of them have been in the North East for two years, instead of six months.&nbsp;</p><p>Olukolade noted that this idea <i>“depends on how the operation goes</i><i>”</i>, confirmed that six-month rotation is sacrosanct, especially for foreign missions. Nevertheless, he reminded that the commanders know the appropriate time to rotate the troops, and a soldier must be ready to remain where he was posted, regardless of how hazardous it was.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we cannot expect sacrifice from the troops if they lack food, sleeping kits and get only three sachets of pure water in the desert heat. Olukolade responded to this claim, stated that <i>“every action is being taken to meet the comfort of soldiers on that mission”.</i></p><p><strong>Big guns on the battlefield</strong></p><p>Comparing weapons of soldiers and terrorists, the general confirmed that insurgents used large-calibre anti-aircraft weapons for their ground operations. He reminded that the main purpose of such weapons is to shot down the aircraft, while their effectiveness in ground warfare is limited. Other weapon type in Boko Haram’s possession is Browning Machine Guns. However, Olukolade denied their decisive superiority, added the success on the battlefield is a matter of training and the will to fight.</p><p><i><strong>* Terrorists’ armoury captured around Lake Chad in March 2014</strong></i></p><p>The general said superiority of Boko Haram weapons, seen on photos from captured or seized arsenals, can be explained by the fact that these fighters form an <i>“undisciplined setting”</i> and they can <i>“come with all kinds of weapons – just one group”</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to him, the grades of weapons on service in the military are still higher.&nbsp;</p><p>The situation with weapons on the battlefield is graded by the regimentation of the system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources for the army</strong></p><p>The DHQ official was upset by claims that budgetary money was being stolen in the Nigerian Armed Forces:</p><p>The general reminded that that each soldier is entitled to N30,000 a month and must be fed three times a day. It is necessary to fuel their patrol vehicles and tanks. Weapons’ servicing also requires money. Therefore, these imaginable N2billion may never go into <i>“somebody’s pocket”</i>.</p><p><strong>Where are the missing girls?</strong></p><p>In the final part of the interview Olukolade made comments on <u><strong><a href=#>abduction of GGSS Chibok female students</a></strong></u>.</p><p>In the next few hours <u><strong><a href=#>he reacted to new Shekau’s threats</a></strong></u> from <u><strong><a href=#>fresh Boko Haram video</a></strong></u> in almost the same words.</p><p>He further condemned spreading of false information, as it has a negative effect on the morale of the troops. Olukolade does not believe the rumours that all of the girls were trafficked out of Nigeria, added that the military is making searches for the Chibok girls frantically.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3aEj29loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bruna-lirio-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bruna Lirio - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

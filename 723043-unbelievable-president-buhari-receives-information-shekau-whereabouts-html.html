Some say he has been removed and replaced by a less charismatic terrorist leader.</i></p><p><i>"I think he must be on the run, because out of the 14 local government districts that Boko Haram used to call their caliphate, they now do not control any now. They are scattered around the Sambisa forest and they have resorted to attacking soft targets, people in churches, mosques and market places, and using improvised explosive devices."</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHN%2Fj21qZq2el7KttcSvmJuklWK9s7HSopuepqRir7a0wKugZqqVmLKqwsSsZKKmlqS%2Frq3ToqanZaOdsqyt1GauoZ2imq6ju9StqmegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./415001-bitter-cerellac-storm-one-kenya-alliance-principals-differ-presidential-candidate-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bitter Cerellac: Storm in One Kenya Alliance as Principals Differ on Presidential Candidate</span></a>

These prices range on the average from N150 to N250 per litre currently.</i></p><p><i>"The meeting also noted that the main reason for the current problem is the inability of importers of petroleum products to source foreign exchange at the official rate due to the massive decline of foreign exchange earnings of the federal government. As a result, private marketers have been unable to meet their approximate 50% portion of total national supply of PMS.</i></p><p><i>Following a detailed presentation by the Honorable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, it has now become obvious that the only option and course of action now open to the government is to take the following decisions:</i></p><p><i>"In order to increase and stabilise the supply of the product, any Nigerian entity is now free to import the product, subject to existing quality specifications and other guidelines issued by Regulatory Agencies.</i></p><p><i>" All Oil Marketers will be allowed to import PMS on the basis of FOREX procured from secondary sources and accordingly PPPRA template will reflect this in the pricing of the product.</i></p><p><i>"Pursuant to this, PPPRA has informed me that it will be announcing a new price band effective today, 11th May, 2016 and that the new price for PMS will not be above N145 per litre.</i></p><p><i>"We expect that this new policy will lead to improved supply and competition and eventually drive down pump prices, as we have experienced with diesel. In addition, this will also lead to increased product availability and encourage investments in refineries and other parts of the downstream sector. It will also prevent diversion of petroleum products and set a stable environment for the downstream sector in Nigeria.</i></p><p><i>"We share the pains of Nigerians but, as we have constantly said, the inherited difficulties of the past and the challenges of the current times imply that we must take difficult decisions on these sorts of critical national issues. Along with this decision, the federal government has in the 2016 budget made an unprecedented social protection provision to cushion the current challenges.</i></p><p><i>"We believe in the long term, that improved supply and competition will drive down prices.</i></p><p><i>"The DPR and PPPRA have been mandated to ensure strict regulatory compliance including dealing decisively with anyone involved in hoarding petroleum products."</i></p><p>The vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo hinted earlier on Wednesday that Nigeria had reached a point where tough decisions had to be taken.</p><p>He said: “No matter how we slice it, we are in economic times that are challenging, but they provide us with some of the best opportunities for making a real difference in our economic life.</p><p><i>“I think that we are at a point that a lot has been said about subsidies and what to do with subsidies. I think we are at a point where we must make many difficult decisions and make very tough choices.</i></p><p><i>“But I think the Nigerian people are prepared for all what is required and all it would take to make a real difference. “In no way can a country make the kind of progress we expect it to make without being able to ensure that in public life our finance system is transparent and would ensure that there is accountability."</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXOCmG5uZpqimq6stc2gZJ%2BtlaF6tMHBrKCdsV2nsq671Z6bZqaVrHqxvsicnGaepZq5br7Er5yapJWZe6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-south-west-govs-are-christians-ffk-weigh-in-on-apc-tinubu-muslim-muslim-ticket.html><span>←</span><span>All South-West Govs Are Christians</span></a>

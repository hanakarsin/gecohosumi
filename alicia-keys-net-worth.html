At a young age, Alicia knew she wanted to sing and began performing in musical productions as early as preschool. She started taking piano lessons when she turned 7 and continued studying music throughout her childhood.</p><p>Alicia focused on choir, theater, dance, and music throughout her entire childhood! The fact that she is where she is today makes a lot of sense based on how much energy and effort she focused on being a talented singer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmqr8iaZKSdqah6r7HTZq6oqqSd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1089003-who-bobrisky-explaining-everything-wanna-know-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Bobrisky?

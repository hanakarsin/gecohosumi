Andy spent years fighting against the invalid moderation policies that allow social media platforms to continue hosting footage capturing extreme violence such as deadly attacks. However, the relentless lobbying turned out to be futile.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"We’re flagging the stuff. Nothing's coming down," Andy told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent</a> before adding that, "This is crazy. I cannot tolerate them profiting from my daughter’s murder, and that's exactly what they do."&nbsp;</p><p>As the next step of the campaign, Andy filed an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FTC complaint</a> against the way YouTube handled the atrocity. As he claims, the social media platform has deliberately misled consumers about the process of removing violent content, reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vice.&nbsp;</a></p><p>According to the complaint, YouTube's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines contains insufficient details regarding content moderation policies, which constitute deceptive trade practices.&nbsp;</p><p>As Andy claims, there are more violent pieces of content available on the platform than the content provider publicly admits. As he prompts, YouTube actively discourages individual users from flagging down problematic pieces of content, and many attempts to do so go overlooked.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>According to The Independent, the platform refuses to acknowledge the complaints.</p><p>"Our Community Guidelines are designed to protect the YouTube community, including those affected by tragedies," reads the press release cited by The Independent.&nbsp;</p><p>"We specifically prohibit videos that aim to shock with violence, or accuse victims of public violent events of being part of a hoax.

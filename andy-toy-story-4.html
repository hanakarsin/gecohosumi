Bonnie Hunt will also return as Bo Peep, though Mr Potato Head's original actor, Don Rickles, sadly died in 2017 before he was able to record any lines. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele will join the franchise as a pair of carnival prize plush toys named Ducky and Bunny. Tony Hale will also join the cast as a homemade toy suffering an existential crisis, Forky.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We imagine there will plenty more conspiracy theories about who is who in the movie as we get closer to release but for now let's just ponder how different Andy looks.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrulxYytprJlo6m8s8WMbQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-pdp-governors-to-meet-jonathan-atiku-kwankwaso-others.html><span>←</span><span>PDP Governors To Meet Jonathan, Atiku, Kwankwaso, Others</span></a>

If someone says a banned word then their microphone is muted. Over the course of the show and the different hosts who've led it, there have been several rule changes. With Tony Reali taking over hosting duties from Max Kellerman years ago, Around the Horn now penalizes panelists who've been muted with a -1 point deduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For the most part though, the show's taken on a bit of a Whose Line Is It Anyway? approach where the points are ultimately left up to Tony's discretion. Guests are also muted if they interrupt another guest whilst talking, and there have been instances where visitors have suffered deductions for shameless self-promotion or tooting their own horn for being right about a particular game prediction.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are some recurring panelists who make up the "cast" of 'Around the Horn.'</h2><p>The program has had some of the same recurring panelists appear on the program several times, with host Tony Reali being the show's primary mainstay. Clinton Yates can be regularly seen as a panelist as can Sarah Spain, J.A. Adande, Kevin Blackstone, Ramona Shelburne, Bob Ryan, Bill Plaschke, Woody Paige, Mina Kimes, Frank Isola, Israel Gutierrez, and many others.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One of the biggest discussions that was had on the series recently was the replacement of Los Angeles Clippers head coach Doc Rivers. Doc's one of the most respected strategists in the NBA and took the Clippers deep into the playoffs before ultimately succumbing to the Denver Nuggets in a series that Kawhi Leonard and Paul George's team, at least according to matchmakers, should've had in the bag.</p><p>Basketball fans were anticipating an L.A. vs L.A. showdown in the semi-finals leading up to the NBA Finals, but that simply wasn't the case. Sadly, a lot of the blame fell on Doc Rivers' head, not the fact that the Clippers were in dire need of a point guard, something that Kawhi Leonard has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly requested himself</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ty Lue has reportedly been slated to fill in for Doc, who was actually very encouraging of Ty's initial foray into coaching, telling the basketball player as he was nearing retirement he'd be a natural leader for players. This was mostly due to "intangibles" like being able to tell those on the court what they don't want to hear.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ty Lue is finalizing a five-year deal to become the next coach of the Los Angeles Clippers, sources tell ESPN.</p>— Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) <a href=#>October 15, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>What do you think of the Clippers' decision? Should they have kept Doc and just try to get a point guard? Or was Ty Lue the right choice? I guess we'll see what happens in the 2021 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bwwc2dZK2glWK1sL7NZpmapp6asW7DzqubrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-used-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Used - Members, Ages, Trivia</span></a>

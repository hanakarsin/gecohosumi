Most recently, we found ourselves wondering about Ben Zorn (aka Ben Z.) from Season 11 of The Bachelorette (Kaitlyn Bristowe’s season). Where is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ben Z. from </u><u>The Bachelorette </u><u>now</u></a>? Here’s what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Ben Z. from ‘The Bachelorette’ now?</h2><p>True Bachelorette fans know that Ben Z. made it pretty far in Season 11 of the show. He was eliminated shortly after the group arrived in Dublin, Ireland. At the time, Ben said he felt blindsided when he didn’t get a rose and commented that Kaitlyn was a woman his mom “would have been proud to meet.” Ben also appeared on Season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise. However, he ended up quitting the show in week three. But don’t worry — while Ben’s Bachelor journey was over, his search for love was not!</p><p>Shortly after leaving Bachelor in Paradise, Ben met <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stacy Santilena</u></a>, a dental hygienist from San Jose, Calif. The two started dating and (drumroll, please) got engaged after two years together! The couple was spending time together near Lake Tahoe in August of 2019 when suddenly, Ben proposed (and Stacy obviously said yes).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“On Friday, August twenty-third at approximately 6:30 p.m., the most amazing man in the world became mine forever!” Stacy wrote on<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Instagram</u></a>. “I still pinch myself every day that he is my boyfriend, now I’m trying to wrap my head around him as my fiancé!” They quickly dove into wedding planning and booked a July date at a California ranch. Alas, their wedding plans — along with many other engaged couples’ hit an unexpected obstacle.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ben and Stacy had to postpone their wedding until next year.</h2><p>Like many engaged couples planning to get married in 2020, Ben and Stacy made the difficult decision to postpone their wedding due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Putting off our wedding was obviously not ideal,” Stacy wrote on Instagram. “But we are looking for the positives. Our celebration of becoming one is something not only for us, but our friends and family too. So it was an easy decision to wait until we can all be together and celebrate when it’s safe.”</p><p>Even though wedding planning has taken a backseat, Ben and Stacy are making the most of their time social distancing together. They’ve been posting home workout videos (Ben is a personal trainer and lifestyle coach), and Stacy has even been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>practicing her dental hygiene skills</u></a> on Ben. Along with their dogs Zeus and Lucy, Ben and Stacy seem to have high spirits and a lot of love for one another. We wish them the best in their future together!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KvedlmmZqbmJq5sL7EraueZZ6kxA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ogun-police-engage-in-gun-battle-with-kidnappers-fails-to-free-lagos-pdp-chairman.html><span>←</span><span>Ogun Police Engage In Gun Battle With Kidnappers, Fail To Free Lagos PDP Chairman</span></a>

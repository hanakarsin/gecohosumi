"You brought that again. It was awesome," he says.</p><p>When we first meet her in Chicago, 25-year-old Bo's preliminary performance blows away judges and viewers alike. Her verse is equal parts rap and poetry, and we learn she comes from a musical family — her brother, a rapper and grandfather a jazz singer.</p><p>"It's funny that people say that," she says when they comment on how poetic Bo's verses are.&nbsp;</p><p>"I never performed slam poetry... I didn't start taking music seriously until my serious year of high school.

She beats out the rest of her Chicago peers and lands among the Top 8 on the whole show.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, she gets on the nerves of the judges during the Battle round and just barely advances.</p><p>But Big Mouf' Bo is ultimately asked to pack her bags, after debuting her song "Capitol Hill" during the Music Video round.&nbsp;</p><p>"This video is not it," Chance the Rapper says upon seeing it. "the video did have a lot of wide shots that weren't too great," Big Mouf' Bo admitted. "But the thing that got me was that they weren't feeling the song."</p><p>Now that she's home, Bo is focusing on a full-length album called Anger Management. "I haven't released a project since high school," she says, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chicago Tribute</a>, "so I'm looking forward to this new project." "The show was just a great learning experience," she added. "Probably the biggest lesson I took from it was just to relax and breathe."</p><p><a href=#>Rhythm + Flow</a> is streaming on Netflix.

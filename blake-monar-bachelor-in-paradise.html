A contestant on Season 16 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, he didn't have that much luck with stealing <a href=#>Clare Crawley</a>'s heart. But the tides will likely turn around soon.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Blake and Tia hit it off immediately on 'Bachelor in Paradise.'</h2><p>"Should I pack my bags now?" said James Bonsall, Tia's current partner, soon after Blake stepped foot inside the Hotel Playa Escondida in Sayulita, Mexico. "It's like Intro to Heartbreak every week."</p><p>Although James gifted Tia a rose only recently, their relationship seems to have been rocked by Blake's arrival. Blake and Tia went on a date in Episode 8, and they got on like a house on fire.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Blake Monar (@blakemonar)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Blake is the one person that I wanted to see here.

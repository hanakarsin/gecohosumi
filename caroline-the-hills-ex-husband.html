He and Caroline got married in 2012, had their daughter Isabella in 2015, and got divorced sometime after that (it's unclear exactly when, but it seems like it happened recently).</p><p>While Caroline is now dating Ryan Daniel O’Leary, she and Bobby seem to get along as co-parents.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>It's unclear if Bobby just operates one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">D'Amore's Pizza</a> (hence the name change), since the company has six locations in Los Angeles. Back in June, he advertised a billboard for the new pizza place name, writing, "What’s up #LosAngeles," with no explanation.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bobby Alt (@bobbyalt)</a></p></figure><p>Bobby also performs in a band called the Alt Brothers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bobby Alt (@bobbyalt)</a></p></figure><p>If you're familiar with Caroline, then you might have heard about the drama between her and Kaitlynn Carter (yes, the same Kaitlynn Carter who also dated Miley Cyrus). Let's unpack that for a second.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened between Caroline and Kaitlynn Carter?</h2><p>Last week (on June 16) on The Hills reboot, we saw that Caroline revealed she had feelings for Kaitlynn Carter. Caroline told Kaitlynn, "Over the past several months of us getting super close, I think I have feelings for you." Fans wondered if they were in a relationship, but while Kaitlynn claims there's "a little attraction" between them, they're just friends.</p><p>"Caroline's an amazing woman, she's very grounded, she's really fun. She is this Italian woman who's definitely always going to speak her mind. I really do value her and our relationship, she's obviously a very special person," Kaitlynn said.</p><p>Caroline stated, "I feel like a lot of people can relate to the one or two girlfriends in your life that you are a bit flirty with. Kaitlynn and I are definitely like that. She's so beautiful and I love her energy, so there's a little attraction there."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In the June 16 episode of New Beginnings, Caroline essentially expressed her feelings about Kaitlynn, and Kaitlynn basically rejected her in the most gentle way possible.</p><p>"I do feel like we're so close, so I get why you would feel like that. We're so similar, we literally like share everything with each other. I worry, because I feel like, because we're so close and I have been in a relationship with women and we have that in common, that we have that attraction, that maybe the reason you feel like that is more situational," Kaitlynn said. Caroline replied, "Are you just saying that because you don't have the same vibe?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kaitlynn Carter (@kaitlynn)</a></p></figure><p>Kaitlynn then said she loved Caroline...but not like that. "I love you so much as my friend. But you're in such a new place of being single and exploring who you are, I think it's really important to take the time to find yourself right now. I love you," she said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Caroline D'Amore (@carolinedamore)</a></p></figure><p>Since Caroline is now dating Ryan Daniel O’Leary, it seems like she's probably moved on.</p><p>Watch new episodes of The Hills: New Beginnings every Wednesday at 9 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6zu8uipZ5lpJ2ybrTIpaOsZZWteqnB0puYp5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./just-in-ex-zamfara-governor-yari-flown-to-the-uk-over-serious-health-issues.html><span>←</span><span>Ex-Zamfara Governor, Yari Flown To the UK Over Serious Health Issues</span></a>

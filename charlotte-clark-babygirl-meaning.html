But what is the meaning of the title track?</p><p>In the song, Charlotte sings about the realization of growing up: "How do I stop time? For the years, they go so fast, Don't want to think about it," she croons in the first verse. "I swear everybody's buying houses, We move place again, And we don't see our friends."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Charlotte also sings about "pain up in my shoulder" and doing her "best to eat all my greens 'cause I'm only getting older," which, of course, calls back to the overarching theme of growing up. During the chorus, she encourages the listener (and possibly herself) to live in the moment and jump at any and all opportunities that come their way.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are convinced they hear Harry Styles's voice on "Babygirl."</h2><p>On March 7, Charlotte <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> a TikTok of herself singing along to the chorus of "Babygirl." The video includes text, which reads: "POV: You want everyone you love to be in your new song, so you invade their privacy and use voice memos they've sent you."</p><p>After hearing the brief snippet, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many fans were convinced</a> that Charlotte's former bandmate Harry Styles loaned his vocals to the song ... and we can't blame them! The vocalist who sings the last few lines of the song, especially "it's only just a feeling" and "tell him that you love him," sounds eerily similar to Harry.</p><p>Charlotte has yet to address the speculation, but what do you think?

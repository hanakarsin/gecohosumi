Some of the other guest judges that appeared on earlier seasons include baker and Food Network host Dan Langan, restaurateur and chef Damiano Carrara, and many more.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Food Network has released episode synopses for Season 5 of 'Christmas Cookie Challenge.'</h2><p>Based on these intriguing synopses on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Network</a> website for Christmas Cookie Challenge Season 5, we're in for edible delights including 3-D snowmen, Christmas village puzzles, board games, self-portraits, ugly Christmas sweaters, and more.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Give the gift of ooey-gooey cookies to your loved ones this holiday season! üéÅ An ALL-NEW season of <a href=#>#ChristmasCookieChallenge</a> starts Thursday @ 9|8c.

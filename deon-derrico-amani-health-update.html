In his caption, he wrote that his family still needed his supporters' prayers, but that Amani was set to go home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DEON DERRICO (@deonderrico)</a></p></figure><p>"Thank you to everyone that has prayed for my nephew Amani!" Deon wrote in his update. "As you can see he has been through it, having two liver transplants within two weeks, and being placed in an induced coma up until a couple of days ago! PLEASE KEEP THE PRAYERS COMING, Lord knows how bad we need them / He needs your prayers!! We are all lost without GOD!!!</p><p>In another update, Deon wrote, "We are truly grateful that my nephew Amani is doing much better and he’ll hopefully be released from the hospital within the next two weeks."</p><p>Although things seemed to be going well for Amani in the hours after his second surgery, he experienced complications and was advised he would need yet another transplant.</p><p>Sadly, it seems Amani was unable to recover after his third surgery and passed away on July 20, 2024. Deon announced the tragic news on Instagram, writing, "My family, friends, and fans … It is with great sadness that I #DEONDERRICO announce the passing of my loving nephew Amani Barkley!

In the description, Deon explained that Amani's liver began to "deteriorate, causing him to immediately be placed back on the donors list for another liver, only a week after the second liver transplant."</p><p>While Amani successfully underwent his third liver transplant around June 15, 2024, Deon mentioned that it had put a lot of stress on his body, leading to "other health challenges." He also revealed that Amani had been diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis at just 14 years old, which prompted the first liver transplant.</p><p>Deon and Karen launched the GoFundMe with the hope of raising $17,000 to cover medical expenses and other costs that arose after Amani had to stop working and his mother took a leave of absence to focus on his health. As of July 24, 2024, the family exceeded their goal, raising $17,421. It’s unclear where the funds will be allocated now, but they will likely be used to cover the remaining expenses incurred before Amani's passing.</p><p>Deon also asked for prayers and requested that any monetary gifts be made out to The Deon Derrico and Marian Derrico Foundation. He explained in an Instagram post that "the proceeds will be used to help other families of liver transplant patients and recipients, as well as cancer patients and recipients."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKwuoydnKuqmZi8bq3MmqWiZZiarq3Ax2asqZyRqbI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./29-html.html><span>←</span><span>29 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays</span></a>

I don’t care about what is happening in other parties, my focus is on the APC.</p><p>“But we all know that the occurrence is not only happening in the APC. It’s happening across other political parties too. And because we are the ruling party, our problems are exaggerated before the public.”</p><p>Adamu stated that the APC leadership is worried about the defection of lawmakers elected on the platform to other leading parties, hence the meeting with the APC Senators.</p><p>He said: “There is no responsible leader that would not be worried when he loses one member not to talk of two. At the moment we are faced with the stark reality of our problems.</p><p>“My colleagues and I at the National Working Committee of the APC are committed to face the problem squarely and see the problem as solvable.</p><p>“We are in politics, I don’t know what would happen tomorrow, and nobody does.”</p><p>The APC national chairman stated that there is no guarantee that the issue of injustice being raised by some of the defectors would be addressed.</p><p>He said: “You have no guarantee, we are in politics for God’s sake.</p><p>“I don’t know what will happen tomorrow. How can I foresee tomorrow? I am not the person who saw tomorrow.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FrZp2dpJa2rb%2BMqJ1mmZSWura%2FjKacnqyZo7Ruw8itn2aZoJh6tLHNmquoqqNisq6x0aCcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cung-le-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cung Le - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

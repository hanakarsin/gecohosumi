They make their individual cases for why they should be picked to win. Then, the jury house votes on who they think should win Big Brother.</p><p>Until the season finale, the jury members get to stay in the jury house, which is separate from the Big Brother studio and has its own dynamic.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, do 'Big Brother' jury members get to watch the show?</h2><p>Once jury member make it to the jury house, they're sequestered from the rest of the players and from the outside world too.

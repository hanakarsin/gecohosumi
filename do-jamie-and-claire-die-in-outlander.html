Misplaced in time and hoping to get back to her husband Frank, Claire meets a group of highlanders and eventually falls in love with Jamie Fraser.</p><p>However, a war between Scotland and England forces a pregnant Claire to travel back through the stone circle at Inverness and raise Jamie's daughter with her present-day husband, Frank.</p><p>Following Frank's death, Claire tells her daughter, Briana, the truth about her real father and travels back in time to be with him. But when Briana finds an obituary stating that Claire and Jamie will die in a fire in the 1700s, she knows she must also travel back in time to warn her parents and change their fate.</p><p>With the Fraser family currently living in colonial America on the brink of the Revolutionary War, trouble lurks at every corner.

So, does an enemy of the Fraser family kill Claire and Jamie?</p><p>Well, their North Carolina home does burn down, but luckily, Jamie and Claire make it out alive. And this fire actually pushes the family onto their next adventure, which is a return to Scotland.</p><p>While some key characters may meet their demise in Season 6 of the series, rest assured that the star-crossed couple stays alive.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starz</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Do Jamie and Claire die in the 'Outlander' books? Well, sort of.</h2><p>While both Jamie and Claire have escaped (some may even say cheated) death several times, the two are not immortal. Though Claire does have the ability to travel through time, she and Jamie are still human, which means they can (and probably will eventually) die.</p><p>In the Outlander series premiere, Claire's husband Frank is standing outside and notices the figure of a man staring up at Claire in her bedroom. When Frank goes to confront the Scotsman, he walks right through him.</p><p>A big mystery on everyone's mind has been the identity of the ghost figure, which the book author has confirmed is Jamie. "The ghost is Jamie — but as for how it fits into the story, All Will Be Explained [sic] — in the last book," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote on her website</a>. Additionally, the author revealed during a 2014 Outlander podcast that the ghost of Jamie is "about 25 [years old]" when he is caught staring up at Claire.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Starz</span></figure><p>Fans know that Jamie and Claire are currently in their fifties, so how is the ghost of Jamie in his twenties? Though there are several fan theories, Diana Gabaldon promises that everything will be explained in her tenth and final book.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Season 7 of 'Outlander' threatens new dangers for Jamie and Claire.</h2><p>Season 7, which will stretch into 2024, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly based</a> on the seventh book, An Echo in the Bone. We know that Claire is accused of killing her apprentice, Malva Christie, and in the trailer, terrifyingly, Claire is seen with a noose around her neck.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>But, if the show follows the book series exclusively, then chances are that Jamie and Claire will both make it out of Season 7 alive. That said, reportedly Outlander will <a href=#>end with Season 8</a>.</p><p>Since there are ten books in the series, that's a lot of ground to cover. And, Diana may even write more installments, having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> in 2022, "Well, it depends on Jamie and Claire. If they’re not ready to die yet then I guess I’ll have to go on…"</p><p>We'll have to watch to see how things play out — and you better believe we will! New episodes of Outlander air Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on Starz.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbxutsCmoJ5lkaOxbq%2FLmqCrnV2ZtqZ5yKdkqK2koa6vsMSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trump-hannibal-asylum-confusion.html><span>←</span><span>Woman Attributes Trump Hannibal Lecter References to Confusion</span></a>

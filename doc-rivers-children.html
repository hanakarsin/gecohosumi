An ESPN analyst wrote the top three teams with the most wins in the 2020-2021 season, to which Callie quote-tweeted and replied pointedly, "Hate to see it."</p><p>Doc Rivers helped the Sixers achieve an estimated 154 wins since he took over as head coach in 2020.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Austin Rivers</h2><p>Out of all his siblings, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin Rivers</a> is the only one to play in the NBA.

"A 13-year-old kid, since he's been 10 he's been jumping on planes by himself," Doc mused.

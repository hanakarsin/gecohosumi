In my state, the governor awarded contracts for the renovations of schools and provides security services to them.”</p><p>“In some states where we have highly intelligent people, highly educated people, very enterprising people, like Abia, they are governed by drunkards. The governor of Abia is a champagne drinking man.”</p><p>“Abia people are impoverished more than ever before. Abia people are unfortunate.”</p><p>The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, however, cautioned him against insulting the governor.</p><p>Abaribe who was not pleased with the statement of his colleague charged him to tender an apology to the governor of Abia.</p><p>Abaribe said: “Mr President, I will like to make a clarification. Unfortunately, what has happened here today is one of the problems that you see on social media. I never made any comment on the governor of Kogi State. Never!”</p><p>“What has happened is what we see going on today. People write something and tag your name to it. And if you don’t ask a question, you will not know whether you actually said it or not.”</p><p>“And I see so many things tagged to me but I don’t talk. The last time I saw Nuhu Ribadu, I also spoke to him. Something was ascribed to him that was very deleterious.”</p><p>“I’m very surprised that my good friend and colleague decided to take on the governor of Abia for something I never said.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5FsZp2qkaKubrXNZqqeppGpsm6t0maqppmiqXqisMSynKahXZmytK%2FRopmeq12Wr6qtjKCmr2WRqHqiecOrrKejkaexcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deborah-gibson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Debbie Gibson - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

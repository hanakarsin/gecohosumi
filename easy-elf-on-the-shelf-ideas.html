Body shots and funnels with Barbie? I'm game!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Evil Art Projects</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>The elf is bound to get bored when the family's asleep, so why not have him engage in some mischievous art projects? Drawing on fruit is a harmless (and hilarious) crime, so why not have him get in on a little bit of fun?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Snowball Fights</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My kids woke up this morning to find <a href=#>@MonsterMile</a> having a snowball fight with their Elf on the Shelf. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2IODOJsEjz</a></p>— Neil Bailey (@NTBailey83) <a href=#>December 5, 2018</a></figure><p>Whether you use real snow or 'mallows, there's no doubt in my mind that an elf would start a snowball fight. Set up a scene in which he's kicking butt, taking his reign over the household, or show him at a major loss. Either way, it's bound to make for some serious entertainment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">An Attempt at Flossing</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Listen, flossing is hard, and the elf had to learn this the hard way. Are we referring to dental hygiene or the dance move? Nobody ever really knows.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sippin' Syrup</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>As we know from Elf, syrup is one of the major food groups in the North Pole. Have your elf sip some syrup, or if you're entertaining your roommates, showcase him sipping something a little more tantalizing, like bourbon. Either way, your elf is bound to get thirsty at some point.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ride the Dog</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Your dog will have absolutely no idea what's going on, but he'll look great with an elf strapped to his back. There's no better way to watch the family than having Fido do all the handy work.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Recreate 'The Shining'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>With a little lippy, recreate The Shining by writing the iconic REDRUM in front of a mirror. Again, though, maybe forgo this one if your audience is on the younger side.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hide in TP</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>He knows when you are peeing, he knows when you're awake! Elf on the Shelf has no regard for privacy, and may ultimately hide in a few rolls of toilet paper if he desires. So make sure to wash your hands, or else he's telling old Saint Nick.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Elf on the Shelf Gone Wild'</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Elf on the shelf doing a madness 🤒 mum wasn’t too impressed with my idea <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ltiIneCb4a</a></p>— CASANOVA (@Lewisfurlong123) <a href=#>December 2, 2019</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>No words.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Returning with Vengeance</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>The Elf has returned, and wants us all to know he's here to stay.</p><p>There are so many ways to position your Elf on the Shelf this year, whether it's in a family-friendly manner or if it's totally R-rated. Either way, getting creative is key for Elf on the Shelf shenanigans, so I expect to see some wild Elf scenes this holiday season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmq60xYyeo59ln6N6tbTEZqqhnZybeqqwxJqq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./obesere.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Obesere On Naija News</span></a>

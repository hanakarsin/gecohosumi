The party also fixed February 22 for the conduct of the primary election.</p><p>But according to Omorodion, the fee is outrageous and the party leadership should consider a reduction of the amount.</p><p>“I, as an aspirant, am saying that this amount is outrageously ridiculous.</p><p>“I see the move as a strategy to stifle the voices of those who joined LP with a genuine desire to serve the Edo people.</p><p>“If the party’s leadership reduced the fee to N15 million for the Imo election, why can’t it do the same for the Edo election?”</p><p>“My appeal is that I don’t think my voice and those of others who believe in my project should be muted by this huge amount.</p><p>“A good number of aspirants and supporters may become disgruntled and may just take a walk if the party leadership refuses to budge,” he said.</p><p>Omorodion, who is the LP Chairman, UK chapter, said edo State could be robbed of imminently qualified persons if the fee is not reduced.</p><p>He added, “Edo people may be denied the opportunity of my dream and desires to take the state to the next level.”</p><p>“Yes, other aspirants are also dissatisfied with the fee. We will be meeting on Monday.</p><p>“Hopefully, we will be able to come up with a position on the matter.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FqZp6cn2K0tq7Eq2SlmZKkwrN5z5qprbFdlsCxtdGapa2rXaeyq7HCrWSna2Cieq%2B7zKKlmqyZpLtussSeqmarlaOxbrnErKqan5ViwbB5z5qprbFdobKisMSrqqGhoGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-daryl-hall-sue-john-oates.html><span>←</span><span>Hall &amp;amp; Oates Member Daryl Hall Is Suing Partner John Oates Over a Business Trust</span></a>

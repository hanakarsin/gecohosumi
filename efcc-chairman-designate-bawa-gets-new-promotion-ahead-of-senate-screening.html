Hopefully, this will put to rest the controversy surrounding his eligibility for the role of EFCC chairman. I agree that the promotion should have been effected before his appointment was announced as this would have prevented unnecessary controversies.</p><p>“The truth is that he has been overdue for promotion.”</p><p>In a related development, it was learnt on Saturday that the Presidency is seriously considering appointing a new secretary for the EFCC to replace <strong>Mr Ola Olukoyede</strong> who is still on suspension following his alleged involvement in abuse of abuse and subsequent investigation by the Justice Ayo Salami-led panel set up by the President.</p><p>Meanwhile, former Minister of Education, <strong>Oby Ezekwesili</strong> has accused <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> of <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>enabling kidnapping across the country</a></strong> and pampering bandits.</p><p>In a tweet via her Twitter page on Friday, Ezekwesili condemned the abduction of 27 Kagara students from Niger State, adding that a strange incestuous relationship now exists between the government and abductors.</p><p>The ex-minister claimed the alleged friendship has enabled the industry of abduction to flourish in Nigeria on basic market principles of demand and supply.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5FpZp6ek5h6pLTAoqmmmZ5isaa%2FyKClmqyVYq%2Biw8Bmnp6so2K7psOMqamopZ%2BptrC6jJqfnpmUYrynedKepZqslWLApL7EnqWippdk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dunja-tatomirovic-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dunja Tatomirovic - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

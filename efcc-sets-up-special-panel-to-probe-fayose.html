Sambo Dasuki (retd.), through a former Minister of State for Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro.</p><p>The money was allegedly handed over to Fayose during the build-up to the 2014 governorship election in Ekiti State.</p><p>Fayose’s aide, Abiodun Agbele, and others had been arraigned by the EFCC but Fayose was excluded because of his immunity.</p><p>A source within the EFCC said, “We are expecting Fayose to show up at our office next week. He has nowhere to run to since he is under security watch and cannot leave the country through any land border, seaport or airport.</p><p>“We have also set up a special team of investigators that will interrogate him immediately after the expiration of his tenure.”</p><p>The governor is expected to be arraigned after investigations.</p><p>Apart from the alleged N1.2bn fraud, Fayose is also under probe for alleged contract fraud.</p><p>Meanwhile Mr. Idowu Adelusi, an aide to Governor Fayose disclosed that his principal was ready for the EFCC.</p><p>Adelusi noted that the governor had written a letter to the EFCC indicating his readiness to appear before the commission next week.</p><p>He said, “Governor Fayose is an honourable man. He will not run away. He has already stated that he will make himself available next Monday once his tenure expires. He made this clear in a letter recently. Even when he was not under immunity, the governor honoured the EFCC invitations.</p><p>“The EFCC is not a court of law and cannot declare a person guilty. The governor will be available next week, no doubt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWloZH5xe5BpZp6ek5h6tLHTrGSuqF2ovaavyJqjZqiRo7KtedOoZKmqn5eybrLAsqasnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./unwanted-advances-at-work.html><span>←</span><span>8 Ways to Deal with Unwanted Advances</span></a>

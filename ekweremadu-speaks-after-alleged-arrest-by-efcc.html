I could not have bothered about such spurious tales, but for the concerns shown by my friends and supporters through calls and messages.</p><p>“There was no such arrest and I have never been arrested by the EFCC.</p><p>“The public should, therefore, ignore this and other such hatchet reports and smear campaigns as they only represent the unholy imaginations of the authors and their sponsors,” the lawmaker was quoted to have said.</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;President Muhammadu Buhari has not sanctioned, neither is he in support of any plan to declare <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>a state of emergency</a></strong> in Anambra State.</p><p>This was disclosed by the Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano after his meeting with the President at the Aso Rock Villa on Thursday.</p><p>As earlier reported by Naija News, the two leaders met on Thursday morning and chief among their discussions was the threat made by the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami that a state of emergency may be declared on Anambra by the federal government.</p><p>But addressing state house correspondents after his meeting with President Buhari, Governor Obiano said Malami was on his own regarding the planned state of emergency.</p><p>Obiano said he reported the Minister to the President during their meeting and Buhari distanced himself from any such plan or idea.</p><p>The Governor also described the threat as unfortunate, promising to have a chat with the Justice Minister over his statement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49wZp6jp5q%2FprnAnaxmq6Carqy%2FjJqdrZ2iYq6tuMSgnJ1lkae%2Fpr%2FTZpmyZZWbsKR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./black-market-dollar-to-naira-exchange-rate-today-11th-february-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Black Market Dollar To Naira Exchange Rate Today 11th February 2024</span></a>

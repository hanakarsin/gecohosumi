A lot of that awesomeness can be attributed to actress Millie Bobby Brown's portrayal of the character.&nbsp;
And because the show's become such a widespread cultural phenomenon, people are becoming more enamored with the child stars who are portraying the characters IRL."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The best-case scenario is that you find them safe and sound no matter how long it takes. For one family, they kept searching for their pet <a href=#>dog</a> for over two days.</p><p>After looking tirelessly for their dachshund, they found him alive in a wildly unlikely place, which was a few feet underground. Here's the full story.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@alexandracorby</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This family found their missing pet dachshund underneath the ground.</h2><p>In a series of <a href=#>TikTok</a> videos posted in late September 2023, Alexandra Corby (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@alexandracorby</a>) laid out the harrowing tale. At the beginning of the month, three of their family's pet dachshunds went out into the woods near their home, but only two came home.</p><p>The one dog, Fred, had gone missing. Alexandra then took to social media to see if anyone on the internet had seen him. He was reportedly microchipped, but they still weren't able to locate him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alexandracorby href=#>@alexandracorby</a><p>Our minature dachshund went missing üò™ Fortunatley we were able to locate and save him ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Alexandra's father was especially determined and reportedly "did not give up looking" and even lost sleep over his searches.</p><p>After 48 hours, they found him in the most unlikely of places. Using "drain cameras and hearing equipment," as well as the help of friends and family, they eventually located him underground. To clarify, he had apparently somehow dug himself into a literal hole to the point where he got lost. He may have even been tunneling around.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@alexandracorby</a></figure><p>Once they were able to pinpoint where he was, Alexandra's dad and their little rescue party spared no expense in digging him out. Eventually, they were able to unearth Fred safe and sound. For his part, Alexandra's dad was elated to see Fred alive and well.</p><p>As of this writing, the full story behind the search for Fred will show up on Alexandra's TikTok soon. However, the internet is already highly emotionally invested in this unsettling story and its happy ending.</p><p>Folks in the comments called this situation "typical dachshund" behavior, with this particular breed having a tendency to dig themselves into tiny holes and find themselves lost.</p><p>"Mine got stuck in a squirrel hole," one person claimed in the comments. "Had to move a shed to dig her out. And they [looked] for another hole to dig right away."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alexandracorby href=#>@alexandracorby</a><p>Fred and dad (Post two day search and rescue) üíï the unedited reunion üê∂üòä Never seen a more grateful dachshund. <a title=lostdog href=#>#lostdog</a> <a title=lostdogfound href=#>#lostdogfound</a> <a title=dachshund href=#>#dachshund</a> <a title=diggingdachshund href=#>#diggingdachshund</a> <a title=lovedog href=#>#lovedog</a> <a title=dogsoftiktok href=#>#dogsoftiktok</a> <a title=dachshundlife href=#>#dachshundlife</a> <a title=dogsarefamily href=#>#dogsarefamily</a> <a title=dachshundsoftiktok href=#>#dachshundsoftiktok</a> <a title=weenerdog href=#>#weenerdog</a> <a title=sausagedog href=#>#sausagedog</a> <a title=lostdog href=#>#lostdog</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Corby" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Corby</a></figure><p>Another purported dachshund owner even posited that Fred "was having the time of his life in those tunnels."</p><p>Many even got a kick that even as he was rescued from the ground, Fred nearly snapped at the dad and his fellow rescuers.</p><p>Even if dachshunds are gonna dachshund, there are few stories more heartwarming than a lost pet finding their way back to their family.

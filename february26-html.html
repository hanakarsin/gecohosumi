<span>Almeda Bohannan</span></p><h1>February 26 Horoscope and Zodiac</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Neptune is the planetary ruler of the Pisces and as you were born in the first Decan, or part, of the sign, Neptune actually have twice the influence over your personality. Being the planet of refinement, Neptune's influence can be reflected in your sensitivity, compassion and vision. Your unique planetary influences makes you the most romantic of all the Pisces Decans. At times, you retreat into a world of romantic fantasy, where beauty, love and poetry can be the focus. While this quality allows you to love with great openness, it can become detrimental if you become too vulnerable to others. You will always be the first person to lend a helping hand or supportive ear, but you may run the risk of troubling yourself too heavily with the burdens of others. Remember to take time to address your own emotional and personal needs. In love, find a partner that shares in your value of honesty and romanticism, as this will bring you the most satisfaction and happiness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63MqKysmpmnwamwwLKqZ5ufonypu9GoqpynoJp8p7HBq6yaqqlng2%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./it-happens-every-election-year-ex-party-chairman-reveals-why-pdp-keeps-losing-elections-in-lagos.html><span>←</span><span>'It Happens Every Election Year' Ex-Party Chairman Reveals Why PDP Keeps Losing Elections In Lag</span></a>

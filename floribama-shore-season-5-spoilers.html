Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cast is gathering in a house <a href=#>in Georgia</a>. The season trailer even introduces a new cast member: Aimee's pet pig.</p><p>Ahead of the premiere, <a href=#>Kirk Medas</a> talked exclusively with Distractify to share some spoilers from the new season.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Tensions are still high between many of the house members.</h2><p>Since Floribama Shore aired its first season in 2017, many of the cast members have developed grudges against one another that have held strong as the seasons progressed. Don't expect anyone to be making up this season.</p><p>"There are little things that will build up throughout time and eventually, you know, the cap of the bottle just explodes," Kirk says. "We just let everything loose."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>The season was filmed in the middle of the pandemic, and to maintain social distancing, cast members rarely interacted with others outside of their house.</p><p>"I'd rather be out mingling and talking to people and meeting people," Kirk says. "Because when you're stuck in a house with a bunch of people, obviously for anyone, not even just us, you're going to butt heads and just get pissed off and get irritated about little things."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">But don't expect this season to be any more dramatic than the previous ones.</h2><p>While there are still lingering tensions between the housemates, Kirk says that there were significantly fewer explosive moments between them. He says even Gus and <a href=#>Jerimiah</a> managed to keep their arguments to a minimum.</p><p>"There weren't any fights between them like there were before," Kirk said. "It was, I would say, cordial at least, you know. Nothing really bad. They just kind of just knew they had to exist in the house with each other. And that's it."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nilsa (@nilsaprowant)</a></p></figure><p>Nilsa's pregnancy also meant the house had to be a bit tamer than in previous seasons. "We couldn't really turn up as much and we had to be quiet at certain times of the night to respect her," he says "It's kind of hard because usually, we're pretty rowdy and turn up and get loud and fight, but we had to hold back a lot just to make sure she had a healthy pregnancy."</p><p>But the calmness was welcomed this season, Kirk says. After so many explosive fights over the years, he welcomed a chance to let things blow over a bit better.</p><p>"I want to get back to how it was the first couple seasons where everyone got along and had fun," he says. "You know, this time has been kind of stressful, people have been fighting and holding on to grudges, life's too short for that bulls--t."</p><p>Watch Season 5 of Floribama Shore on Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7mwvsibmKaZXai1sL7EZqqemaOku26BjKynqKGcmr%2B0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./darcey-silva.html><span>←</span><span>Darcey Silva Latest News and Updates</span></a>

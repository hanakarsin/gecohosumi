So if anyone finds opportunity under such cover to blackmail the governor as being at loggerhead with the villa, it will be unfortunate.</p><p>The commissioner added that ”But if it happens, we won’t be surprised because some persons take politics to boundless levels not minding whether the well being of their folks is endangered or not.”</p><p>However, on the purported pending defection of Mimiko to APC, one of the aides to the former governor said his principal has no plan to join a new party.</p><p>The aide who spoke on condition of anonymity was quoted as saying truly Mimiko went to Abuja but the trip was not political neither did he have any meeting with the APC leaders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49rZp%2BnoqKys3nOp5uoZaOprrWxjKCmr52io7yzecyipKKjn2LApsCMraZmop%2Beu26tz5xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./armani-versace-html.html><span>←</span><span>Armani Walton - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

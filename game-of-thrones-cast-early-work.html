Though a few were staples on British TV, Game of Thrones is definitely their most well-known project to date. For a few, like Kit Harington, Maisie Williams, and Sophie Turner, it was their first screen role ever.</p><p>Now that winter has come and gone, we thought it would be fun to take a look even farther back to what some of the actors did before they came to Westeros. However, in some cases, we're guessing they'd probably rather we didn't.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Syfy</span></figure><p>Khaleesi didn't have too many acting credits before nabbing the role of Daenerys Targaryen, and if we were her we'd like to forget starring in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triassic Attack</a>. It's a Syfy network B movie in the spirit of Sharknado only less entertaining. Also Emilia's supposed to be Native American in it? So, yeah... that happened.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Merchant Ivory Productions</span></figure><p>Though not her first role, Lena's first role in a major film was as a member of the housekeeping staff in the Merchant Ivory classic The Remains of the Day, starring Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins. How weird is it to see the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms as a maid here (alongside Ben Chaplin, who played a footman)?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. Nicolaj Coster-Waldau (Jamie Lannister)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Thura Film</span></figure><p>Nicolaj is Danish, so a lot of his pre-Thrones work is in Scandinavian TV and film. Here he is in the 1994 film Nattevagten (AKA Nightwatch) as Martin, a law student who moonlights as the nightwatchman at a forensic lab who gets mixed up with a serial killer. Actually sounds like it might be pretty good — at least better than the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American remake</a> that came out three years later.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Universal Pictures</span></figure><p>Long before being Dany's most trusted advisor, Iain Glen was a research assistant to Sigourney Weaver's Dian Fossey in the 1988 biopic Gorillas in the Mist. Unfortunately, his time on the research team gets cut short when he sleeps with another researcher.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MGM</span></figure><p>Before Game of Thrones, Alfie was more famous for his sister Lily's song about him than his acting work. He had a couple small roles as a kid but perhaps the most random pre-GOT job he had was as a bass player in Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. Conleth Hill (Varys)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Channel 4</span></figure><p>Before playing the Spider, Conleth and his full head of hair starred in a ton of television in the U.K. His big break came in 1992 when he was cast in the Brit-com Blue Heaven, which in typical U.K TV fashion ran for seven episodes over three years.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7. Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros</span></figure><p>It's pretty crazy to look at this photo of Liam as Captain Crewe in the 1995 children's classic A Little Princess and realize he and the Onion Knight are one and the same. (He also plays <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Rama</a> in the dramatizations of his daughter Sara's stories.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8. Gwendoline Christie (Brienne of Tarth)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Infinity Features</span></figure><p>Prior to Game of Thrones, Gwen hadn't done a great deal of acting work, but she did play "Classy Shopper 2" in the 2009 film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, which includes Heath Ledger's final performance (there he is on the right).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9. Rory McCann (Sandor "The Hound" Clegane)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Channel 4</span></figure><p>Can you believe this adorable little baby face is The Hound? From 2002 to 2003 he played Kenny McLeod on the Channel 4 series The Book Group, which is about an American in Scotland who forms a book club to make friends. His character was an aspiring author who has a disability and required the use of a wheelchair. A major departure from the tough killer bodyguard we know and love.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">10. Jerome Flynn (Bronn of the Blackwater)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Euston Films</span></figure><p>Fun fact: Jerome Flynn and Iain Glen never shared any scenes on Game of Thrones, but the actors go way back! They were both in a 1988 crime drama called The Fear where Iain (center) is the leader of an extortion and protection ring and Jerome is Freddie (upper left), a member of his gang.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">11. Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm)</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Grey Worm wasn't Jacob's first acting role but I'd rather talk about his secret R&B career instead! He records and produces under the name Raleigh Ritchie and he's actually really really good.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">12. Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Goldcrest Films</span></figure><p>Charles has had a long career spanning more than four decades. But with 150 credits to your name, they're not all going to be winners. Here is ol' Tywin in 1996 as a space pirate in a movie called Space Truckers. Yikes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">13. Julian Glover (Grand Maester Pycelle)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Pictures</span></figure><p>Julian Glover's career stretches even farther back to the late 1950s, but American fans probably remember him best as Nazi sympathizing grail seeker Walter Donovan in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">14. Aidan Gillen (Petyr Baelish)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Price Entertainment</span></figure><p>Pretty much everybody already knows Aidan aka Littlefinger played Mayor Tommy Carcetti on The Wire, but way before that he played Aidan in the 1995 romance Circle of Friends. Fun fact: Ciaran Hinds, who played Mance Rayder, is also in this movie!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">15. Joe Dempsie (Gendry Baratheon) — with bonus Hannah Murray (Gilly)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Company Pictures</span></figure><p>Before he was a heartthrob on Game of Thrones, Joe was a drug addicted hedonist on Skins, a popular British teen drama that was remade into a far inferior U.S. series for MTV. Joe played Chris and Hannah was his roommate Cassie. At the end of series two of the show, Chris dies of a brain hemorrhage and a traumatized Cassie runs off to New York City.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6usYyonWasmKe8r7HSZpqaq6RisqK%2By7JksKeioA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./262841-top-cnn-anchor-richard-quest-fly-kenyas-inaugural-direct-flight-ny-globally-renowned-quest-means-business-show-html.html><span>←</span><span>Top CNN anchor Richard Quest to fly on Kenya's inaugural direct flight to NY for his globally renown</span></a>

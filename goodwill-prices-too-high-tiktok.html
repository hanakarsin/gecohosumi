Remember when <a href=#>TikTok</a> user <a href=#>Don C. called KFC out for its incredibly high prices</a>? He was totally over the fast-food joint after being charged $57 for his order. In his video, he claimed that going out to a sit-down restaurant was cheaper than ordering fast food. And many folks in his comment section agreed.</p><p>Well, now we have a similar complaint, but this time, in the fashion department. A TikTok creator named Essie (<a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">@essielesse)</a> discussed how <a href=#>Goodwill</a> had <a href=#>hiked up its prices</a>, and she's not too thrilled about it.</p><p>The secondhand store sells items donated by the community to the public, with proceeds helping to fund programs that assist families in low-income areas. Because most of the items sold have been gently used, they are priced to reflect that. Or at least they used to be.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">TikToker claims that Walmart has better prices than Goodwill.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@https://www.tiktok.com/@essielesse</a></figure><p>‚ÄúCan anybody tell me what has happened to Goodwill?" she says as she begins her video tour of the so-called discount store.</p><p>She explains that in her local Goodwill, there aren't any fitting rooms or mirrors, so shoppers are forced to buy items without even knowing if they'll fit.</p><p>‚ÄúWhy would I spend $15 on a pair of used pants that I can't even try on?," she quipped as she examined some price tags.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@essielesse href=#>@essielesse</a><p>when did they get so expensive.

"And now a single t-shirt is $6," she explained as she moved her camera towards the price tag, adding "Walmart has them cheaper for that."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@https://www.tiktok.com/@essielesse</a></figure><p>Essie also browses the housewares section where there seems to be more trash than treasure. She picks up a small transparent cube with the White House etched on it, and a price tag of $8. Yet she couldn't figure out the item's purpose.</p><p>She also checked out some plants. "I have these exact plants from Ikea and I bought them for $5,‚Äù she says as she checks the price to see that it's also $5.</p><p>Later in the tour, she comes across a towel. ‚ÄúYou can go to Bed Bath & Beyond and get a brand new luxury towel for $8 or you can get an old one for $6 that I‚Äôm sure has been used by like a family of seven," she says as she pans her camera to the worn-out towel.</p><p>As she gets in her car to leave, she gives her final opinion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs literally cheaper to go to Walmart." Although Essies's video was uploaded in 2022, there has been a slew of other videos posted in recent months, all of which echo Essie's complaints regarding Goodwill's high prices.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@adrian_peru href=#>@adrian_peru</a><p>I like goodwill but some prices are Ridiculous‚Ä¶ <a title=goodwill href=#>#Goodwill</a> <a title=donation href=#>#Donation</a> <a title=expensive href=#>#Expensive</a> <a title=jeans href=#>#Jeans</a> <a title=shocked href=#>#Shocked</a> <a title=used href=#>#Used</a> <a title=thrift href=#>#Thrift</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Adrian" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Adrian</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Some people seem to think Goodwill has become "greedy."</h2><p>Users in the comment section couldn't help but agree with Essie. Some folks went as far as to call the chain greedy. After all, who would want to spend nearly the same amount on a used item when they could purchase it brand new?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@https://www.tiktok.com/@essielesse</a></figure><p>Another user couldn't believe Goodwill had the audacity to charge so much for items that were donated to them.</p><p>And one user found the perfect words to sum Goodwill. "It‚Äôs essentially a used TJ Maxx."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@https://www.tiktok.com/@essielesse</a></figure><p>We can't argue with that. Hopefully, Goodwill will consider lowering its prices. And perhaps examining donations more thoroughly before they go on the sales floor. We wouldn't want another customer to come across a <a href=#>urn with ashes</a> inside, would we?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLywsNaio6VloKe2pLHSZquop12dtqi0jK2gpKyfoA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-nolan-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Katie Nolan - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

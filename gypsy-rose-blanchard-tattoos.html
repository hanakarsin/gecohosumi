But what tattoos does Gypsy have in total, and what do they all mean? Those who watch her Lifetime docuseries Gypsy Rose: Life After Lockup know a bit about her ink.</p><p>Unfortunately for Gypsy, she can't get any tattoos for the foreseeable future, since she's <a href=#>pregnant</a>. And, she assured her followers in a July 2024 Instagram post, all of her tattoos were done before she found out she was pregnant. That's not to say she doesn't already have some lined up for after she gives birth, though.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kenurker</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What tattoos does Gypsy Rose Blanchard have?</h2><p>When Gypsy visited her cousin Bobby Pitre's tattoo shop on a trip to Cut Off to visit her dad with then-husband Ryan Anderson, she knew she needed a tattoo right away. Viewers saw her get a tattoo several inches long on the inside of her forearm. It's an unalome, which is a symbol that means a number of things, including chaos, transition to nirvana, nirvana, and enlightenment. It's a Buddhist and Hindu symbol meant to reflect someone's journey to enlightenment.</p><p>Another one of Gypsy's tattoos has a different meaning, and it's likely to be a sore spot for Ryan for as long as he mourns the end of their marriage. Toward the end of their relationship, Gypsy got a matching tattoo with then-ex Ken Urker, who she is now with again. The tattoo is a husky in a heart design that makes up one half of a heart. Ken, of course, has the other half as a tattoo to match.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gypsy-Rose Blanchard (@gypsy.rose.blanchard.insta)</a></p></figure><p>Gypsy's biggest tattoo, however, is spread across her back. It's an all-black symbol and somewhat abstract version of a phoenix rising from the fire. Tattoos seem to be a form of art that allow Gypsy to express herself, whether it's in relation to a romantic partner or how far she has come since her release from prison. And it wouldn't be surprising to see her indulge more after she has her baby.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ryan Anderson got a tattoo in Gypsy's honor.</h2><p>When Gypsy got her arm tattoo on Gypsy Rose: Life After Lockup, her now-ex, Ryan, got a tattoo as well. His is a rose on his bicep, and you don't have to think too hard to know the meaning behind it. Sadly, the meaning will remain with him until he covers it in some way. But for now, although Gypsy broke things off with him and filed for divorce, she's still with him in a small way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"I didn't plan on getting a tattoo, but I'm getting one," Ryan says on the show. He then explains that the artist drew up a rose with petals that look like a fleur-de-lis, which Ryan calls "the Florida leaf." He later shared on a TikTok live that he didn't get as many leaves done as the artist recommended. However, it's safe to say that in hindsight, it's probably best that he didn't spend more time on the tattoo that was inspired by Gypsy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnMaxv9hmqairlWKvra3NnJ%2BaqpRiwaLA06imrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1919-html.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Born in 1919 | Famous Birthdays</span></a>

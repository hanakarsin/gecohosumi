Engaging in blame games is also not the way to go. All of us are members of the National Economic Council, where we have the opportunity to make our input. I don’t think my colleagues have exhausted that avenue.</p><p>“I don’t know when they stopped supporting that economic policy, but they are familiar with the cliche that you cannot make an omelette without breaking an egg.&nbsp; We were all aware of the temporary hardship the policy would cause, but that will soon give way to prosperity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BtZqGZopnAqbXPZpuopqRitq%2BvyK2cZqiVpL2tsYyanpqhnqjBbrLGZpipm12cvLe%2FjJyYrqyZpLtuvMOpZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1541136-eniola-badmus-stirs-mixed-reactions-refusing-tag-braider-ig-post-i-paid-html.html><span>←</span><span>Eniola Badmus Stirs Mixed Reactions after Refusing to Tag Braider in IG Post, Says &amp;quot;I Paid for It&amp;quot;</span></a>

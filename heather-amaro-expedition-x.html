For the first seven seasons, the team consisted of <a href=#>Josh Gates</a>, <a href=#>Jessica Chobot</a>, and Phil Torres, who acted as the team scientist, as they traveled and explored locations with purported paranormal activity. In the first season, Jessica and Phil were the primary explorers, with Josh as the host. That has since changed.</p><p>As the series progressed, Josh became more involved, stepping into the role of team lead. When news about Season 8 slowly began rolling out, fans began to notice that Jessica seemed to be missing from the trailer and other promo materials. It was later confirmed that <a href=#>Jessica was no longer on the show</a>. So, while Jessica will not be featured in Season 8 of Expedition X, Discovery did bring a new face into the team: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather Amaro</a>, a paranormal investigator. Here's what we know about her so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Discovery</span><p>Phil Torres, Josh Gates, and Heather Amaro</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Meet the newest addition to the 'Expedition X' team, Heather Amaro.</h2><p>Heather Amaro is, according to her bio, a third-generation paranormal investigator, and has done many investigations with her mother. She introduced herself in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> shared by the @expeditionunknown account. In it, she reveals some fun facts about herself. She says that she was born on the day of the summer solstice, which has some paranormal significance. She also says that she has a rescue dog and that she loves going on adventures, making her a good fit for the team.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Discovery/Instagram @heatheraamaro</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans are suspicious that an alleged feud with Josh Gates may be the reasoning behind Jessica Chobot's exit from the show.</h2><p>Social media detectives are ever-vigilant, and after noticing the absence of Jessica from the promos for Season 8, they headed to Instagram. There, they noticed that Jessica was no longer following Josh while still following Phil and also following Heather. There had been whispers in the past about "creative differences" between Josh and Jessica on the show. While no one is sure of what exactly happened between them, it does seem as if there was some sort of rift between them, but the show must go on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Discovery</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jessica Chobot's fans need not worry, as she has shared she has a new show with Discovery in the works.</h2><p>After confirming that she would no longer be a member of the <a href=#>Expedition X team</a>, Jessica shared some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hopeful news</a> for the fans who were sad about her departure. She did not reveal much but did say, "I’m working on something new with Discovery… Here’s a hint. It’s the weird s--t that I love mixed with other weird s--t that I love! The perfect combo." She also wished Phil and Heather well in the new season. <a href=#>Josh's name</a> was not mentioned at all, which also is a big hint that they had a falling-out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbKiwMeeqWaZnZa%2FsHnEsaeenJmptrC6jLE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./over-40-advice-for-people-20s.html><span>←</span><span>People Over 40 Share the Best Life Advice They Have for Young'uns in Their 20s</span></a>

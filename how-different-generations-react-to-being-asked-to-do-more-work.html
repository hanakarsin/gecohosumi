Heck, Reddit's antiwork sub has some 2.6 million subscribers and is regularly populated with content from folks who've about had it up to here with their bosses and the way they treat their workforce."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The man hits his shoulder against a door jamb (which is supposed to be the person he bumps shoulders with).

They hit shoulders with the person then look at them and give the person a bit of lip, presumably telling them to watch where they're going, or asking them what their problem is.</p><p>Next up are the '90s babies, who make a bit of a stink of the fact that this person just bumped their shoulder. They pantomime an over-exaggerated amount of pain and widen their eyes as if to say, "geez what was that person's problem."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @carlow1967</span></figure><p>Last up are folks born in the 2000s, they bump shoulders with the other person and crash to the ground in a dramatic sprawl that would make any novella actor proud. They pause their grimace for a second while on the floor as they get out of their smartphone, then start over-acting how in pain they are while they record themselves, probably to broadcast their victimization to the rest of the world.</p><p>There are a number of folks who've expressed that Gen-Z'ers appear to be obsessed with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">victimhood</a>, but many pieces that blast "victim mentalities" are usually met with criticism and that folks who label calling out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"victim mentalities"</a> are simply refusing to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledge that someone is suffering or facing hardship</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOinZ%2Bdopq7tXnGnqWeqpGptrC60mapnpmTqXq1u4ybnKKml2KutLfEnWStp12ZvG65zqucZq%2Bfp7g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richmond-va-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Celebrities Born In Richmond, Virginia</span></a>

Here’s what the application entails and what Khloe's trainer says about surgery claims.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: E!</span></figure><p><a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a> is proving to people that she's more than just famous for being famous. With the recent premiere of the third season of her hit show Revenge Body With Khloé Kardashian, the reality star is helping transform people's lives with healthy nutrition and workout tips from herself and reputable trainers.&nbsp;</p><p>But how do you get on Revenge Body, you ask? Read below to find out, and earn if her trainers think Khloés enviable body is from surgery.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So how do you get on Revenge Body? The application process is tough!&nbsp;</h2><p>There is no single body type that has been featured on Revenge Body, and many of the people featured on the show are simply trying to have better relationships with their own bodies. The July 21 episode of the show featured Eddie, a man struggling with an eating disorder after breaking up with a cheating ex. The episode focused on Eddie gaining weight in muscle, which opposed many episodes that feature participants' weight loss.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: E!</span></figure><p>The application for the show is intense and applicants can expect to get into the nitty gritty of their personal lives and history with food and exercise. The applications are divided into men's and women's (the following information was taken from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">women's application</a>). In addition to the basic biographical information, the application also asks for information about pets, kids, and what clubs you did in high school and college (stressing Greek life in particular).</p><p>Potential participants are also asked to discuss specific moments from their childhoods — like what their dreams were and what their most embarrassing moments entailed. People also must classify their social clique in high school, with some examples including "jock, cheerleader, and bookworm."&nbsp;</p><p>Details like the person's living situation and TV preferences are also featured. One of the most extensive sections of the application is the "Self Image" one, where applicants must list their current workout habits and fashion tendencies. There is also a section where you rank words and how you feel they apply to you like "sexy, snobby, and confident." Potential candidates must also consider what role they play in their families and friend groups too, and how frequently they date and go out.</p><p>The Revenge Body application certainly isn't for the faint of heart, and any applicant should be willing to get honest with themselves before filling it out. Those who are interested need multiple character references to make sure that many of the answers can be vetted. Those with particularly compelling applications are then contacted by The Conlin Company (which casts the show).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Khloé's trainer sounds off on those plastic surgery rumors.</h2><p>Every member of the KarJenner family has been accused of photoshopping Instagram posts and getting extensive plastic surgery. While we'll likely never get much confirmation on the plastic surgery front (minus Kylie's lip filler admission), Khloé's trainer, Luke Milton, says that the star works out for her body, and it's not the result of weight loss surgery.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Luke, who is also featured on Revenge Body, said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Daily Telegraph</a> that Khloé's toned body is a result of her hard work at the gym. Khloé's strict workout regimen — which includes boxing and circuit training — is supported by a diet of eating seven smaller meals per day. "She's extremely committed to her fitness endeavors, she's extremely disciplined with her nutrition," Luke said, "and she is a real athlete in the gym."</p><p>If you've now realized that the application process for the show is too intense or you're inspired by seeing the workouts on TV, then you can get your Khloé fix by watching Revenge Body. It airs on Sundays at 9 p.m. on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOoZLKnpWK0psCMqKVmqpWrsq%2BzxGaZqJyp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pastor-enenches-daughter-breaks-silence-on-her-alleged-relationship-with-frank-edwards.html><span>←</span><span>Pastor Enenches Daughter Breaks Silence On Her Alleged Relationship With Frank Edwards</span></a>

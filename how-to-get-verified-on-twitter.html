To some, it refers to someone interacting with or referencing a known celebrity or public figure in order to get their own name out by association. To others, it means a ton of followers and likes.</p><p>And then there are those who just want that sweet blue check mark next to their social media profiles. So it's only natural that tons of people are trying to figure out how to get <a href=#>verified on Twitter</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Want to get verified on Twitter? Here's how to do it.</h2><p>Twitter announced that it has introduced a new way of getting verified on the platform. If you've always wanted to know what those blue check marks mean, Twitter explains: "The blue badge is one of the ways we help people distinguish the authenticity of accounts that are of high public interest. It gives people on Twitter more context about who they‚Äôre having conversations with so they can determine if it‚Äôs trustworthy, which our research has shown leads to healthier, more informed conversations."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How do I know if I'm eligible for a blue badge on Twitter?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter's official blog</a>, a user's account must fall under at least one of the following six categories:</p><ul><li>Government</li><li>Companies, brands, and organizations</li><li>News organizations and journalists</li><li>Entertainment</li><li>Sports and gaming</li><li>Activists, organizers, and other influential individuals</li></ul><p>But that's not all ‚Äî you'll also need to complete the platform's verification policy checklist. That means that your profile must have a name (to combat bots) and a profile image. You'll also need to confirm your email address, phone number, and have an active Twitter account for at least six months, without breaking the rules of the platform. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You can check to see what those rules are here</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So we‚Äôre baaaaaaaaaack</p><p>Follow us for all things blue badge on this bird app <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EUI81qCrr7</a></p>‚Äî Twitter Verified (@verified) <a href=#>May 20, 2021</a></figure><p>In a nutshell, if your tweets haven't been flagged as hateful, incendiary, or if your account's never been found of disseminating false, harmful, or misleading information, you should be able to pass the check.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">If you're interested in applying to get Twitter-verified, here's how to do it.</h2><p>Twitter states that it's gradually adding the verification application to individual user's account settings.

So if you've always lusted after one of those check marks and wanted to lord it over your friends, or are worried about someone impersonating you online, you can rest assured knowing that there's a clear way to get verified on the social media platform.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Figured I'd put in a Twitter <a href=#>@verified</a> request for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Really in this weird spot where I class as a journalist, a content creator and an influential person so I had no idea which to go for.

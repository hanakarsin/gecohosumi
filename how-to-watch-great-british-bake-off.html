But, don’t fear, we have a solution to your streaming problem. To stream a U.K. network, it is recommended to use <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ExpressVPN.</u></a> This app will hide your IP address, making you virtually invisible from the border protected site. &nbsp;</p><p>However, there is a small fee for this service. ExpressVPN charges $12.95 per month for service. Though, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if viewers “find they can’t watch Channel 4 in the USA or abroad – or any other content for that matter!”&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not looking to sign up for another streaming service, you could always wait until Season 10 appears on Netflix. Yes, the British baking show also has a partnership with the streaming giant. However, the streaming service has not yet announced when the reality competition series will be available. So, you may just have to satiate your baking appetite with a few reruns until new episodes are uploaded.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Channel 4</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meet the 2019 cast of the new season of Great British Bake Off.</h2><p>Season 10 of the reality series will follow these amateur bakers competing in a slew of challenges that test their baking aptitude.

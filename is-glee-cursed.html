On July 13, 2013, he was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in Vancouver's Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel. He was 31. Toxicology reports found a lethal mixture of alcohol, heroin, codeine, and morphine in his blood.</p><p>After years of sobriety following substance abuse issues in his teens, Corey relapsed and sought treatment in March of 2013 after an on-set intervention. He was written out of the last two episodes of Season 4 to allow him to complete treatment.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>The fifth season was delayed to allow the cast, including then-girlfriend Lea Michele, to process the loss, and the third episode of that season, "The Quarterback" dealt with the death of his character, Finn, and was dedicated to Cory's memory.</p><p>Since his passing, Corey's former co-stars have kept his memory alive on social media. On July 13, 2023, on the 10th anniversary of the actor‚Äôs death, Lea Michele posted a touching tribute on Instagram, reflecting on how his loss affected her and everyone who knew him.</p><p>‚ÄúHey you,‚Äù Lea captioned beside a black and white photo of her and Corey. ‚Äú10 years. It feels like only yesterday that you were here and yet a million years ago, all at the same time.

Josey Dorsey, Naya's 4-year-old son with ex-husband Ryan Dorsey, was asleep aboard, unharmed. Josey told authorities his mom had gone for a swim and then found herself unable to re-board the vessel. While her son was wearing a life vest, Naya's vest was on board.</p><p>Search efforts continued for several days, with the search and rescue effort re-classified to a recovery mission as it became more apparent Naya had not survived. On July 13, 2020, authorities confirmed they had found and identified Naya's body in Lake Piru. In a sad coincidence, the date officials discovered Naya‚Äôs body was also the seventh anniversary of Cory Monteith's death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Melissa Benoist's domestic violence claims.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>While Melissa Benoit, who played Marley Rose on Glee, did not name the former partner who physically and emotionally abused her, a <a href=#>timeline of her relationship with ex-husband and Glee co-star Blake Jenner</a> makes it seem likely Blake (Ryder Lynn) was the romantic partner in question. Benoist's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">emotional Instagram Live video</a> detailed years of abuse, the most severe incident occurring when her assailant threw a phone at her, hitting her in the eye.</p><p>"The impact tore my iris, nearly ruptured my eyeball, lacerated my skin and broke my nose. My left eye swelled shut, I had a fat lip, blood was coursing down my face and I can remember immediately screaming at the top of my lungs," she said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In a 2016 appearance on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Melissa attributed that injury to a clumsy accident, a tactic many abuse survivors use to protect their abusers or out of misguided shame over their situation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The suicide of Mark Salling amid child pornography charges.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span><p>Salling in 2010 (L) and at a 2016 court appearance (R)</p></figure><p>On Jan. 30, 2018, <a href=#>Mark Salling</a>, who played Noah "Puck" Puckerman, was found dead from an apparent suicide by hanging at 35.

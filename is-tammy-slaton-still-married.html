However, they have reportedly split, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Sun</a></p><p style=text-align:start>“They split up because Caleb hasn’t been following his diet in rehab,” a source told the publication. “He has gained 30 lbs. and hasn’t been working his program.”</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> previously reported, Tammy exited the rehab facility (where the couple met) in February after a 14-month stay, leaving her partner behind. The plan was for Caleb to transfer to a new clinic in Kentucky to be closer to her, but according to a source, Caleb hasn't been proactive about making those arrangements with his insurance yet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don’t think Caleb has good intentions for Tammy <a href=#>#1000lbSisters</a></p>— Ashlee (@AshLeeBrooke08) <a href=#>March 15, 2023</a></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People,</a> the rehab center Tammy and Caleb were both staying at was the Windsor Lane Rehabilitation Center in Gibsonburg, Ohio. Tammy checked into the center in late 2021 and Caleb proposed to her in October 2022 in the center's parking lot. They tied the knot at the facility on Nov. 19, 2022, surrounded by 30 of their closest friends and family members.</p><p>In January, a month before checking out, Tammy spoke with the outlet about their wedding and gushed, "Our wedding day was perfect, there was so much love in the room," adding "I literally married my best friend."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In May 2023, Tammy was reportedly already dating a TikTok star.</h2><p>According to reports, Tammy, 36, may have already moved on from her marriage to Caleb with a 25-year-old TikToker named Greg Morgan.

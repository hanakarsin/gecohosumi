Fans are concerned for her role as Special Agent Lucy Tara. Here's what we know about it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for </strong><strong>NCIS: Hawai'i</strong><strong> Season 2.</strong></p><p>One of CBS’s hit shows within the <a href=#>NCIS</a> universe, <a href=#>NCIS: Hawai'i</a>, is in its second season. The crime-fighting drama is one of the newer in the franchise, but it has garnered quite an audience, and it's always evolving. Since it began, the show has sent off several central cast members and introduced some new ones.</p><p>In 2021, NCIS: Hawai'i shook things up again by adding actress <a href=#>Yasmine Al-Bustami as Lucy Tara</a>. Lucy joined the NCIS team as a Special Agent and immediately shined with her story arc. However, fans are wondering if she has a future on the show, given that she's been MIA for a bit.</p><p>So, is Yasmine Al-Bustami leaving NCIS: Hawai'i? Find out what we know about the actress’s future on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Lucy leave 'NCIS: Hawai'i'?</h2><p>During Season 2 of NCIS, fans watched Lucy struggle with her and her girlfriend <a href=# style=text-align:start>Kate’s (Tori Anderson)</a> relationship. The couple broke up in earlier episodes, which forced Lucy to apply for the NCIS Agent afloat position, a job that requires her to be away from Hawaii for four months.</p><p>In Episode 7, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanishing Act</a>,” Lucy discovered she got the afloat job. The only problem? She and Kate are back together now. The reunion made Lucy question if she should still take the job or stay and continue working on their relationship. However, a heart-to-heart with Kate on the beach convinced Lucy to take the opportunity.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NCIS: Hawai'i (@ncishawaiicbs)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is Lucy coming back to 'NCIS Hawai'i?'</h2><p>Unfortunately, fans won't be pleased to know that there is no telling when Lucy will make her return to NCIS: Hawai'i. Since Lucy's departure, showrunners haven't give any signs or hints for when she and Kate will be able to reunite.</p><p>Not to mention, Lucy's job assignment is for four months, so it could be some time before we see her again. After all, the time frame has to be reflected in the storyline.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>However, there's no need to panic about Lucy's return. Sure, it sucks that viewers won't be able to see Lucy and Kate's relationship blossom on-screen, but we do know that Lucy won't leave the NCIS: Hawai'i universe forever.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a> reports that Yasmine and fellow actress Vanessa Lachey had an impromptu Instagram Live session in October 2022, where the actresses answered fan questions and discussed all things NCIS: Hawai'i.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Yasmine confirmed that Lucy will appear in the upcoming three-way crossover between NCIS, NCIS: Hawai'i, and NCIS: Los Angeles. In fact, Yasmine shared some intel about the crossover taking a week to film in L.A., with the actors having to endure 10-hour shooting days.</p><p>So, while it remains unclear when Lucy will make her grand return to NCIS: Hawai'i, fans can breathe a sign of relief — for now. Season 1 of the series featured 22 episodes and if showrunners follow suit, there is more than enough time for Lucy to be reunited with Kate.</p><p>Catch new episodes NCIS: Hawaii Mondays at 10 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuxcCspKKmlWKurXnBrqqtmZ2eeq2xwK%2Bgp59do7Cqv4yhmLCZmZ4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./246196-jina-la-utani-la-anne-waiguru-ambalo-pia-limempendeza-uhuru-kenyatta-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jina la utani la Anne Waiguru ambalo pia limempendeza Uhuru Kenyatta</span></a>

He showed him how to smile without drawing attention to his gums, sent him to acting and vocal lessons, and gave him strict instructions to walk and talk in a more masculine manner.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"There was something very marketable about it [...] He saw them as commodities, and things to be shaped and molded from his own personal factory," Jim Parsons, the actor playing the much-dreaded actor in Hollywood, told Vanity Fair.</p><p>Henry exercised a great deal of control over Rock's career and his personal life. He gave him a stage name audiences would find more appealing. He even instructed the young actor to dress up as a life-size Academy Award for the 1948 ceremony, a publicity stunt that almost cost him his life.&nbsp;According to Vanity Fair, the full-body paint ended up causing severe breathing difficulties.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The sacrifices did pay off eventually, and by 1952, Rock appeared in movies like Scarlet Angel, Horizons West, or The Lawless Breed.&nbsp;By the end of the decade, he was mentioned on the same page as James Dean, Charlton Heston, or John Wayne — the biggest names in the industry.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jake prepared for the role by carefully studying Rock's body language and mannerisms.</h2><p>"I watched his films on silent to study his body language. I listened to his interviews while I was driving in my car to study how he speaks," Jake told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Advocate.</a>&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>A lifelong Rock Hudson fan, Jake approached the role with a heightened sense of caution. He paid an equal amount of attention to the various archival documents preserving intricate details about Rock's personal and public life.&nbsp;</p><p>"Being on a show that reflected an era I was already in love with was surreal. The era itself was incredibly romantic, the colors, even in the way people spoke [...] There’s a certain level of obligation I felt, playing someone who’s such a hero, an icon," Jake told The Advocate.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was hard not to, in the first few days on set, to feel the presence of Rock watching, and I had to remind myself to just be present and listen," the actor added.&nbsp;</p><p>Stream Hollywood on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66ssYypoJyjmaO0brTOpaOyr5%2BksW66xK2dpaGo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-does-gregory-porter-wear-a-hat.html><span>←</span><span>Gregory Porter Says His Signature Hat Accidentally Became a Thing</span></a>

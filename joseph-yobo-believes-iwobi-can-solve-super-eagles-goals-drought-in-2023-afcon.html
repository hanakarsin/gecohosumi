So, we are not getting much from the attacking midfield,” Yobo according to AfroSport.</p><p>“We have more defensive players and you can only work with what you have. We don’t have creative attacking options, what we have are players from the flanks either as full-backs or wing-backs.</p><p>“In the midfield, I think when Iwobi peaks, when he plays to his strength, I think we will see his creativity up front.”</p><p>Yobo added, “We have been solid defensively and even our goalkeeper hasn’t been really tested. That means we are doing something right there and we have to take the positive from that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FuZqOno5q9qXnYqJmoZZKauaqx1Z6qZqGnpK%2BqecKapWarn6HDpnnSrqeeql2arqi4xKxkoKeRocBusNGorKCgpGK2r3mRaWlsZZGbsLC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ex-super-eagles-star-victor-ezeji-tells-eagles-how-to-use-paul-onuachu-in-afcon-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Ex-Super Eagles Star, Ezeji Tells Peseiro How To Use Onuachu In AFCON 2023</span></a>

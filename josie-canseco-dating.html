Hits me right in the f--king chest. I’m like, shocked," he said. "And then figured out maybe that’s why she went to Atlanta a week early. And I’m like, oh my god, I feel so f--king stupid.”</p><p>While rumors swirled that the other "guy" was singer Jack Harlow, Addison commented that his accusations were very "one-sided."</p><p>With Bryce newly single, rumors have surfaced that the TikTok star is once again off the market.

At all. In any way. [Please] stop,”&nbsp;Josie tweeted on June 4. “How many times do I have to say I’m completely single. Being friends with someone and being supportive and close to them IS NOT dating. End of story.”</p><p>Bryce commented on the tweet, jokingly writing, "Wait, we're not dating?" He added, "Dating/being friends is the same s--t [to be honest]."</p><p>While the influencers addressed the dating rumors directly, we're sure some fans will still always "ship" the rumored couple.

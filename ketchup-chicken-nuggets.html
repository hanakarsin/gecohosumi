Source: TikTok/@thefoxsaystwinsKids see the entire world as one great big, soft, tissuey, napkin-ey canvas for them to wipe their grubby little paws and runny little noses all over, especially when they haven't learned how to blow their noses yet.
This means that when they finally do sneeze, they usually propel a sizable amount of thick, multiple-days-back-up booger gel right from out of their noses and all over their chins, and they're going to find the first place they can to rid themselves of the gross substance."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Often, at least half of what they eat ends up on their cheeks and lips, or on couch cushions, car seats, curtains, people's clothing, or anything else they see as suitable wiping services.</p><p>Oftentimes, it's the person closest next to them who ends up being the unlucky recipient of their face-wiping rampage. This is something that this bride learned, and took in stride, in a viral TikTok posted by user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@thefoxysaystwins</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thefoxsaystwins href=#>@thefoxsaystwins</a><p>Do not recommend serving ketchup with the chicken nuggets and fries for the kiddie meal…or just don’t invite kids <a title=bridefail href=#>#bridefail</a> <a title=imsoembarrassed href=#>#imsoembarrassed</a> <a title=weddingwhoops href=#>#weddingwhoops</a> <a title=rehersaldinner href=#>#rehersaldinner</a> <a title=kidfreewedding href=#>#kidfreewedding</a> <a title=kidsaremessy href=#>#kidsaremessy</a></p><a title="♬ dumb dumb - sped up - mazie" href=#>♬ dumb dumb - sped up - mazie</a></figure><p>In the video, a bride can be seen posing for the camera, as a little toddler walks up to her dress, grabs it, and then begins wiping her face all over it.</p><p>A text overlay in the video reads: "When you can't find a napkin so you use the bride's dress." Initially, the bride doesn't know what's going on, but when she looks down and sees what the kid is doing, she can't help but laugh.</p><p>In a caption for the post, the TikToker quipped: "Do not recommend serving ketchup with the chicken nuggets and fries for the kiddie meal…or just don’t invite kids"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@thefoxsaystwins</span></figure><p>Numerous commenters who responded to the post said that the post is a prime example as to why it's never a good idea to invite children to a <a href=#>wedding celebration</a>.</p><p>"No kids at my wedding," one person penned.</p><p>Another said: "Child free wedding," while another remarked, "This.

Is it all right to insist that there's no kids present at your very serious and grown-up celebration of your eternal love (or eventual settlement)? Or do you think that's whack and kids are the ones who end up having the most fun at these things without being inebriated, but just act like they are?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLK1r8eup2abmJ6wrLHNZqWun5eawbQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./february26-html.html><span>←</span><span>February 26 Horoscope and Zodiac</span></a>

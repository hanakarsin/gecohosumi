We clearly don't give you enough credit, Luda.</p><p>The 39-year-old recently shut down claims that his music career is over. “[It’s] definitely not dead, not at all,” he said in an interview with The Shade Room.&nbsp;“I’m just taking my time putting out some more music. When you get to the ninth album stage and you’ve sold over 20 million records, sometime it’s a process and you just gotta take your time with the process. It’s expected. Any artist that takes a lot of time in-between albums, you always gonna have people that say [they're done]. But music is number one. If it wasn’t for music, I wouldn’t be where I’m at right now."</p><p>The Illinois-native has also had a successful film career, starring in five of the eight "Fast and the Furious" movies alongside Vin Diesel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#><u>These Forgotten Reality Stars Are Still Living Their Best Lives&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>12 Cherished Celebs Who Did Terrible Things You Wish You Didn’t Know About</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>Can You Guess Which “Makeup-Free” Celebrity Is Actually Still Wearing Makeup?</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYCOamhokqqKmbS7jqWsnZmTp7a0ecKgoGaZkqh6tcPIraueql2nsqKv06Kmp6s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./316230-list-countries-monarchy-governments-html.html><span>←</span><span>List of countries with monarchy governments in 2020</span></a>

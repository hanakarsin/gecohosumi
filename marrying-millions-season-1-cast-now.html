At least, that's what we learned after the first season of <a href=#>Marrying Millions</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">See what the Season 1 cast of 'Marrying Millions' is up to now.</h2><p>The Lifetime docu-series followed six couples from vastly different socioeconomic backgrounds as they hoped to prove that love conquers all. But were they successful?</p><p>Here's where the <a href=#>Season 1 cast</a> is now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Drew and Rosie</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Drew and Rosie seemed to have the odds stacked against them, given their age gap and the fact that they met on sugardaddy.com. But despite it all, they made it down the aisle ‚Äî and are happily together still. The duo frequently posts photos together on their social media feeds, and Rosie fondly referred to Drew as her "quarantine buddy."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sean and Megan are still together, even without the prenup.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>A real life princess @meggirll so beautiful ü•∞</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Sean Lourdes</a> (@seanlourdes) on Aug 2, 2020 at 8:40pm PDT</p></figure><p>When Sean and Megan were about to tie the knot, Sean's father strongly suggested he and Megan sign a prenup before going ahead with their vows. As the son of AUGE Media Publishing, Sean's father felt his son had a lot to lose, despite Megan and Sean already sharing a 5-year-old together.</p><p>But despite the family fears, it seems that Sean and Megan are still very much together and very much in love. One look at their Instagram feeds will convince you theirs will be a long marriage.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Katie and Kolton</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Katie and Kolton may have seemed ready to face the world together at the end of Season 1, but apparently their relationship didn't last much longer after that.</p><p>‚ÄúAfter the season ended, Katie told me ‚Äòthe age and wealth gap is a huge thing for me. I‚Äôm done‚Äô which absolutely blindsided me,‚Äù Kolton told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheatsheet</a>.</p><p>Apparently, Katie blocked Kolton on everything, and the two are officially over.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gentille and Brian</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Gentille and Brian clearly had some skeletons in the closet from the beginning, as Brian kept it hidden that he lived with his parents and had previously had relationships with other wealthy women. They had seemed oh-so determined to make it down that aisle... until Gentille called it all off at the last minute.</p><p>Understandably, that was the end of their relationship, as Gentille's Instagram alone makes it clear she's too busy focusing on her career to worry about what Brian's up to.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bill and Brianna</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Fun dinner in South Beach with the hilarious @davidleeroth69, the talented local artist @gamsonart and my babe @limit_less___ !</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Bill Hutchinson</a> (@billhutchinson) on Jul 15, 2020 at 7:02am PDT</p></figure><p>Bill and Brianna had the largest age gap on the show, as the couple had almost four decades between them. Add to that the fact that Bill's been divorced twice, and the fate of their relationship didn't look promising.</p><p>But despite not actually making it down the aisle in Season 1, it appears these two are still happily together, further trying to disprove the rumors that their relationship is fake.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shawn and Kate</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>When this musical couple got together, things were rocky from the beginning. Probably the most memorable and most cringe-worthy moment of the season was when Kate threw a fit at Shawn after finding out that the "diamond" bracelet he got her wasn't real diamonds. Yikes.</p><p>That was where their time on the show ended, and that might've also been when their relationship ended. Neither of them have been spotted on each others' social media feeds for some time, so it's safe to say they're probably over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zvtiipaBlnZ65rbXOp6pmq5WWwLC6jGpknJmjqXqvu9Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./serap-sues-nnpc-over-failure-to-account-for-nigerias-daily-oil-production.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>SERAP Sues NNPC Over Failure To Account For Nigeria's Daily Oil Production</span></a>

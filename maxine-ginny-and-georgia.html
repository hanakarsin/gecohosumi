One character who many are agreeing is a star is Maxine, who is better known as "Max."&nbsp;</p><p>While Ginny is adjusting to being the new kid at her high school, Max quickly takes her under her wing. Max introduces Ginny to her clique, who refers to themselves as "MAN" (Maxine, Abby, Norah). They soon alter their name to MANG to include Ginny.</p><p>Their friendship starts out as one of support (unlike the Rory and Paris dynamic on Gilmore Girls), and Max opens up about being gay. Ginny also shares some details about her past.</p><p>But, things do become difficult when Ginny develops feelings for Max's twin. She keeps her burgeoning romantic feelings to herself, so as not to jeopardize her friendship with Max. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Before 'Ginny & Georgia,' Sara Waisglass starred in two 'Degrassi' spin-offs.</h2><p>The 22-year-old Toronto native has been acting since she was 7 years old, and she's best known for playing Francesca "Frankie" Hollingsworth on both Degrassi: Next Generation and Degrassi: New Class.</p><p>The character first appeared on Next Generation in 2013, and her final episode aired in 2015.</p><p>New Class was the fifth and last addition in the Degrassi franchise, and it ran for four seasons on Netflix before officially wrapping in 2017.

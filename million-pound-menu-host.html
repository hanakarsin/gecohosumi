Indeed, Fred Sirieix was born and raised in Limoges, France, and it was his upbringing that helped him develop his affinity for the kitchen.</p><p>"The conversation around the dinner table was all about patient care," he said of his parents, who worked in healthcare. "It was about making sure people had a good experience." This kind of attention to service is what drove him to a lifelong front-of-house career in France and the U.K.</p><p>"What I'm good at," he continued, in an interview with The Guardian, "is looking at the customer journey, at the what and the how. There are key touchpoints in it that have to be managed. You must see, smile, and say hello to people before they can do it to you."</p><p>His passion for service led Fred to author a book, Secret of Service, after leading a long career in the food industry. He's trained as a chef, and has worked at a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in France and in England, including La Tante Claire, Le Gavroche, and Park Lane.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>He's appeared on several British TV shows, including First Dates, First Dates Abroad, and Michel Roux's Service. He's also appeared on BBC One's The Apprentice, and Channel 4's Tried and Tasted: The Ultimate Shopping List.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, after two seasons of hosting Million Pound Menu, Fred came up with the idea of Remarkable Places to Eat, a BBC Two series where chefs take Fred to their favorite restaurants in different cities.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fred started the viral #NationalWaitersDay.</h2><p>Back on Christmas Day 2012, Fred had the idea to celebrate the front-of-house restaurant staff and attract people to the hospitality profession by creating #NationalWaitersDay. Now, seven years later, the day has amassed some popularity and Fred is adding a competitive game to the day's festivities.</p><p>"Inspired by the original 'course des gar√ßons de caf√©' which began over a century ago in France, the Waiters' Day competition involves hundreds of waiters racing with trays of water and bottles without spilling or dropping anything," reads the official copy posted on Fred's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> page.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Guess what I said to make #fruitcake üç´‚ù§Ô∏è roll her eyes like this üòÇüòÇüòÇ best caption wins 2 tickets to the opening party of our new bar @10degreeslondon @galvinatwindows 28th floor @londonhiltonpl on the 3rd September üëçüèª</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Fred Sirieix</a> (@fred_sirieix) on Aug 10, 2019 at 2:51am PDT</p></figure><p>Last year alone, National Waiters' Day managed to raise over 30,000 GBP to "help those with barriers to employment achieve sustainable careers in the hospitality industry."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fred has two children, Andrea and Lucien.</h2><p>Over on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, which offers a more private look at life, Fred seems to now be dating a woman he refers to as "fruitcake."</p><p>While his current partner has managed to remain anonymous throughout their worldly adventures, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smooth Radio</a> notes he was in a long-term relationship with ex Alex for 12 years.

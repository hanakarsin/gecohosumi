We don’t need growth based on speculations that government officials are celebrating all over the place.</p><p>“The biggest engine for economic growth is the micro, small, medium enterprises. That is the practice all over the World.</p><p>“That engine today is not being supported in Nigeria. Nigeria has a total of 40 million SMEs but there is not a properly articulated fiscal and monetary policy to support the critical sector.</p><p>“The entire loan to the private sector on Nigeria today is about N30trn. Less than N1.5trn is going to the SMEs. This is less than five per cent of the entire loan. This means Nigeria is not supporting its engine that can enhance the nation’s economic growth.</p><p>“The SMEs are the biggest employer of labour in many advanced countries of the world. We need fiscal monetary policies that would invest in this engine of growth in order to create jobs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BsZqeao2K%2FprzOq6tmq6SkvW6uzqupqK%2BZo7Russ6rZJynnqjCrrzToqanZZ%2BXtm7AxKWjrGWSqrWivsho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-see-your-first-liked-post-on-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>People Are Going Back in Time to See Their First Liked Post on Instagram</span></a>

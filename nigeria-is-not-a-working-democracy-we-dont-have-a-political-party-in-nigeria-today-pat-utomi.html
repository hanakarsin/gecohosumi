Countries don’t grow by waiting for the next electoral process; countries grow through the founding of political parties.</p><p>“I can say without any feeling of wrongness that we don’t have a political party in Nigeria today. What we have been able to couple together since 199 has been a platform for machine politics, where the game is to grab power rightly or wrongly and share spoils.”</p><p>As a solution, Utomi said he is working on a merger of all the front-runners from the 2023 general elections to present a common platform and put forward one person who can get the job done in 2027.</p><p>“My view is clear on this matter, let’s build a great party that can make Nigeria better. When we then build it, the people from different social movements, in addition to the political parties that come into this one party, subscribe to certain values and ideologies of how you make a nation happen, can then present those who seem interested can go forward.</p><p>“This is what Nigeria needs, and must have but shouldn’t be about some individuals advertising that they are the ones who should go forward, Nigerians will determine that,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49yZqehl5q%2Fqq2Moqpmpp%2BpeqJ51qippKGenHqlscyomquZk656uLGMnaanrF2drrexjJpkqaecnsGqr8ClZKmZoqnGbrXNZqWin5WntqJ506ibmrFdpa61edStpqahXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-tinubus-presidency-cant-stop-yoruba-nation-agitation-akintoye.html><span>←</span><span>Why Tinubu's Presidency Can't Stop Yoruba Nation Agitation</span></a>

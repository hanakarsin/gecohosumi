The Imposter Buhari cannot be coming to Imo State while he continues to detain our leader Mazi Nnamdi in the DSS custody.”</p><p>The pro-Biafra group stated that Nnamdi Kanu&nbsp;must be released unconditionally because he committed no crime known to law.</p><p>IPOB also warned women groups, the clergy men and women, traditional rulers, president-generals and others who may be contemplating going to Owerri on Tuesday to welcome Buhari.</p><p>It added, “If you are in support of Buhari detaining our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, then go to Owerri on Tuesday the 13th day of September and welcome the President.</p><p>“We, therefore, expect all markets, schools, banks, businesses and companies including police stations in Biafra Land to be under lock and key on Tuesday, September 13, 2022 in solidarity with our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.</p><p>“IPOB members are peaceful. We don’t enforce sit-at-home. Nevertheless, we wouldn’t tolerate people flouting IPOB leadership directives.</p><p>“Therefore, everyone in Biafran territory must adhere to this civil action in the form of sit-at home on Tuesday. Biafrans are not known to be cowards because we stand without fear before our enemies.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BpZqemkaKxtnnKmqWuZZmlvKN5w56apZmimsBuv86uq6FllZbAtXnSoqtmmaRitbC5xGaYrGWSqrWivshmraKrmanAbrXMqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-mouf-bo-rhythm-and-flow.html><span>←</span><span>How Far Does Big Mouf' Bo Make it on 'Rhythm + Flow'?

The actor spoke to Eddie Izzard (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SlashFilm</a>) in January 2021 about where the show was actually going to be filmed, saying, "It's so funny – every week there's a new report ... there's another tabloid expose that we're shooting it in some bizarre town somewhere. Then we're meant to be making it in Boston, then, 'No, it wasn't Boston, it was Boston, England.' But we're not. We're shooting it in L.A."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheCinemaholic</a> reported that Obi-Wan Kenobi shot most scenes at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MBS Movie Campus</a>, a movie studio in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where other huge projects like The Mandalorian were filmed. The connection makes sense, given that Obi-Wan Kenobi's director and showrunner Deborah Chow directed several episodes of The Mandalorian Season 1.</p><p>The outlet also stated that other filming locations included El Segundo, Calif., and an abandoned village in the town of Little Marlow in England (locals were reportedly not thrilled). Sequences were also apparently shot in Glen Tilt in Scotland.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bespin Bulletin</a> also spotted a production crew that was reportedly tied to Obi-Wan Kenobi (the production team used the name Joshua Tree, which Bespin Bulletin presumed was a cover for the Kenobi production) filming at a swimming pool at East Los Angeles College.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>During the official Obi-Wan Kenobi press junket, which Distractify attended, Deborah Chow spoke about her excitement utilizing Stagecraft technology for filming. Deborah said, "I started using that technology, stagecraft, on [The] Mandalorian. So I was actually incredibly excited to be able to use it on Kenobi as well."</p><p>Ewan loved working with the Stagecraft sets, saying, "The experience of the first three, especially Episode II and Episode III, there's so much blue screen and green screen and it's hard. It's very hard to make something believable when there's nothing there ... And here we were in this amazing set where, you know, if you're shooting in the desert, everywhere you look is the desert. And if you're flying through space, then, you know, the stars are flying past you as you scout along."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>It'll be interesting to see how the various Obi-Wan Kenobi filming locations translate when episodes drop on Disney Plus, you can catch the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi on the streaming platform on Friday, May 27, 2022. Episodes will release on Wednesday after that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpK%2BqedaapWajlaO8o7WMn6ClpZmjtG64zpyYraGfo8A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./272157-railas-father-committed-sin-kenyans-uhurus-father-miguna-miguna-html.html><span>←</span><span>Railas father committed no sin against Kenyans like Uhurus father - Miguna Miguna</span></a>

Comfortable. Packed with sensors. In our latest pre-order update, we take a closer look at what's going on under the hood of the new Oura ring. . . 1 - The outer shell of the new Oura ring is made out of titanium with diamond-like coating (DLC). When you’ll pick up the new Oura ring for the first time, you’ll probably be surprised at how light it feels. We’ve wanted to make the ring so light-weight that once you put it on your finger, you can forget about it. . 2 - Remember those images where it takes a group of people to move one of the early computers? Fast-forward a few decades and all that – and much more – fits inside a ring. The sensors measuring your physiological signals include: a temperature sensor, a gyroscope, a 3D accelerometer and an infrared optical pulse sensor. . 3 - Wearing comfort has been one of our top priorities from the start, which is why we went with seamless medical-grade inner molding. And now with the introduction of wireless charging, the inside of the ring is just one smooth surface without the tiniest cavities or cracks to collect dirt that could irritate your skin. . Pretty exciting, huh?

"That's when I started to experience it. In 1966, '67. By '69, it got so serious that I stopped smoking dope [marijuana]. I said 'This isn't helping; it's making things worse.' So I didn't smoke another joint for 11 years."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While attempting to get to the root of his depression, Paul stated, "They were feelings about myself that were very negative." He then went on to reference the "bad news" that took a toll on his mental health, including comments about his height, singing ability, and deterioration of his 12-year marriage to Carrie Fisher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul Simon gave fans his farewell tour back in 2018.</h2><p>After recording five studio albums with Simon and Garfunkel and 13 studio albums as a solo artist, Paul decided to hang up his touring hat back in 2018 when he put on "Homeward Bound – The Farewell Tour." This tour was a major run across North America, the United Kingdom and Europe which concluded with a show at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in New York City, nearby to where he grew up.</p><p>On the decision to stop touring, Paul said via his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a>, "I’ve often wondered what it would feel like to reach the point where I’d consider bringing my performing career to a natural end. Now I know: it feels a little unsettling, a touch exhilarating and something of a relief."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He continued by noting, "I love making music, my voice is still strong, and my band is a tight, extraordinary group of gifted musicians. I think about music constantly. I am very grateful for a fulfilling career and, of course, most of all to the audiences who heard something in my music that touched their hearts."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did the farewell tour mean the beginning of Paul Simon's retirement?

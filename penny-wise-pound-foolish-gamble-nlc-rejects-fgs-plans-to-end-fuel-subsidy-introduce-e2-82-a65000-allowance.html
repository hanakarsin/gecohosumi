This is not an outcome that any sane Nigeria wishes for.</p><p>“The argument that the complete surrender of the price of petrol to market forces would normalise the curve of demand and supply as is being wrongly attributed to the current market realities with cooking gas, diesel, and kerosene is very obtuse.</p><p>“The truth is that these commodities which Nigeria can easily produce have been priced out of the reach of most Nigerian families with the majority of our people resorting to tree felling and charcoal for their energy needs.</p><p>“Finally, we wish to warn that the bait by the government to pay 40 million Nigerians N5000 as a palliative to cushion the effect of the astronomical increase in the price of petrol is comical, to say the least.</p><p>“The total amount involved in this queer initiative is far more than the money government claims to spend currently on fuel subsidy.</p><p>“Apart from our concerns on the transparency of the disbursement given previous experiences with such schemes, we are wondering if the government is not trying to rob Nigerians to pay Nigerians? Why pay me N5000 and then subject me to perpetual suffering?”</p><p>“Clearly, government thoughts on the so-called removal of fuel subsidy is cloudy and appears to be a ‘penny wise-pound foolish’ gamble,” he said.</p><p>“It is clear that the palliative offered by the government will not cure cancer that will befall the mass of our people who suffer the double jeopardy of hype-inflation while their salaries remain fixed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FuZqmdnqPGbsPIrJxmqJ%2Bqu6V5xaimpaGjnXqorcybo55lnqGwbr7Eo5ycrKNis6i%2FjKmjmqajYsGwecSnm2aepZq5br%2FUm6qinKlitq%2FA0aibrpuVYnKGfoRxaV55Zmp9cXyMmqOlp6eWu6Sxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./senegal-sets-march-24-presidential-election-date-after-delay.html><span>←</span><span>Senegal Sets March 24 Presidential Election Date After Delay</span></a>

Babylon "traces the rise and fall of multiple characters during an era of unbridled decadence and depravity in early Hollywood," according to it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMBD page</a>.</p><p>With her upcoming film opening in theatres everywhere on Dec. 23, the people are wondering (and we are wondering) who is Phoebe dating these days?

The above picture was posted on June 29, 2020, making Phoebe and Alex Instagram official. However, the picture has since been deleted and there isn't any other evidence of him, although we can't find an official break up statement either.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Before Alex, Phoebe was actually with Vampire Diaries Paul Wesley for a while. Phoebe and Paul started dating in July 2013 and broke things off in 2017. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> reported that "They are still good friends. The relationship just ran its course."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>It appears that the two definitely remain friends! A TikTok posted on Oct. 23 by producer and writer of The Vampire Diaries, Julie Plec, went viral showing cast members of <a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a> and <a href=#>The Originals</a> having a reunion. Phoebe and Paul were sitting next to each other and looked like they were having a great time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@hitrecordjoe</span></figure><p>Phoebe had also been linked to Joseph Gordon-Levitt back in 2012, before she dated Paul.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instragram/@edwestwick</span></figure><p>Phoebe was dated the problematic Ed Westwick as well at the height of his Gossip Girl fame in 2011.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@t22felton</span></figure><p>As we said earlier, this one blew our nerdy, fantasy loving minds. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, Phoebe and Tom Felton, most known for playing Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise dated from 2006–2008. A werewolf and a wizard? Now there's a new YA fantasy book idea for ya!</p><p>Phoebe was also been linked to Australian actor, Xavier Samuel, most recently in the movies Blonde and Elvis (they're rumored to have spent one night together) as well as her co-star on The Secret Circle, Chris Zylka.</p><p>To sums things up, Phoebe has basically dated all of our childhood crushes except for Chad Michael Murray. Specifically Chad Michael Murray from A Cinderella Story, although he's kind of an idiot for not knowing it was Hilary Duff in that mask. Still hot though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbWwscGeZK2nnqC2r3nDmquippc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-to-find-iron-thorns-pokemon-scarlet-violet.html><span>←</span><span>Where to Find Iron Thorns in 'Pokmon Scarlet' and 'Violet'</span></a>

For example, if you're a software developer and you're looking for someone to code in Python, you can ask pertinent questions about the software language and maybe give them an assessment to see how they perform.</p><p>Obviously, you don't expect them to know everything about the job on day one or the specific way your team operates, but an assessment, even though it might be intimidating for some, can let you know if they have the essential skills one needs to be successful in the position.</p><p>Or maybe you just want a basic, general education assessment like this TikToker says they were given on a job application.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@maysunmilk href=#>@maysunmilk</a><p><a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> like ok you got me i dont know how to do basic multiplication what about it <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=jobsearch href=#>#jobsearch</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - maysun" href=#>♬ original sound - maysun</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>Maysun, who posts on TikTok under the handle @maysunmilk, says in a viral clip that she was presented with a series of multiplication questions while filling out a job application.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>She wrote in a caption for the post: "like ok you got me i dont know how to do basic multiplication what about it" and says in the video, "I went to this job interview yesterday and they handed me like an in-person application to fill out. Tell me why they had me doing f--king math?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>She moves her head to reveal a green-screen image of the job application behind her and continues to say, "When I tell you I was f--king sweating." She then covers her mouth and laughs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>Viewer responses ranged from frustration and confusion to bewilderment and anger. Some folks said they would've immediately left without filling out the application and wouldn't even try to get the job because they fail to understand why an employer would hand an applicant a "school packet."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>When asked what sort of job Maysun was applying for‚ with one suggesting it was for a position as "adult kindergartner" — the TikToker clarified that it was a receptionist role.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>"Oof, I [probably] would've walked out," said one.</p><p>"Did they want you to show your work too?" another asked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>A few people suggested it might be a useful screening tactic for some jobs, though. "Wish they did this at the police academy," one joked.</p><p>"They did this when I interviewed for a security job lol," another wrote.</p><p>"The job I just applied to made me take 4 ACT tests….. just to get a phone interview," empathized one viewer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maysunmilk</span></figure><p>Perhaps some not-so-pleasant experiences with previous candidates prompted this employer to issue such a rudimentary assessment.

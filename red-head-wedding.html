Weddings seem to make everyone insane, but especially the bride and groom, who are essentially spending the down payment on a house to get a new profile pic in evening clothes. Of course they want their bridal party to look their best too. These pictures are going to last a lifetime, even if you're blackout during the reception."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It is special to be a part of someone's Big Day. Reddit user&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bridehairthrowaway</a>&nbsp;was so flattered to be a bridesmaid in her friend's wedding that she even entertained an insane request that she received from the bride via email:</p><p>"[The email]&nbsp;seemed pretty standard but then when she got into the look she wants for her bridesmaids she wrote, '[Name], you'll need to dye your hair for the day, I'll take you to my hairdresser and cover the cost :) I'm a natural ginger, so it's not like I have an outrageous hair colour, although [the bride]&nbsp;and her other bridesmaids are all brunettes."</p><p>Now, to me, reading that makes me want to scream, "DON'T WALK, RUN!" But she actually seemed to consider it until the Internet set her straight:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>I [22F] have been told by friend [25F] that I'll need to dye my hair to be in her bridal party</a> from <a href=#>relationships</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>I [22F] have been told by friend [25F] that I'll need to dye my hair to be in her bridal party</a> from <a href=#>relationships</a></figure><p>Across the board people were like, you keep being your read headed self, girl, and let the sun set on that friendship:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I had a fun week in Australia, but now airport time and onwards to Kuala Lumpur & Taipei. üåá #sydney #sydneyharbour #sunset #ocean #redhair #magichour</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by Brian Dowling (@redheads) on May 25, 2016 at 2:41am PDT</p></figure><p>That seemed to settle things, until she shared this completely gross&nbsp;update. Apparently, some sleuthing helped her figure out that the bride's groom has a bit of a thing for red heads.

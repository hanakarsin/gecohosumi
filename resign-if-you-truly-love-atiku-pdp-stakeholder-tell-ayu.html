We can’t continue this wrangling and stalemate with just five days to the lifting of the ban by INEC. From Ayu’s actions and utterances, he doesn’t have the interest of the party at heart.</p><p>“Here is a man who granted an interview on national television saying he is ready to make sacrifices and resign if the presidential candidate comes from the North. Now Atiku has emerged and you refused to do so even when those who made it possible for you to become chairman are asking you to step down.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FsZqudo560r3nIn2Syp6ViwbPBy7JkpaemmnqiwMikrGaolKV6tMDApJyhp5yZsrN5056jpWWRrsJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keep-your-mouth-shut-yinka-quadri-warns-followers-weeks-after-pledging-allegiance-to-tinubu.html><span>←</span><span>Keep Your Mouth Shut - Yinka Quadri Warns Followers Weeks After Pledging Allegiance To Tinubu</span></a>

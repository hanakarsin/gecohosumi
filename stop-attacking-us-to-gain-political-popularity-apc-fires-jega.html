Hence, the Professor should note the political lesson that maligning the APC would not provide him with a springboard to achieve his desires. Nigerians are wiser and remain the ultimate judges”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Southern Nigeria Frontier (SNF) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>berated the Coalition of Northern Groups</a></strong> (CNG) for describing Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere as a terrorist group.</p><p>Naija News earlier reported that the CNG in a statement by its spokesperson, Abdulazeez Suleiman, in Abuja on Saturday asked the federal government to proscribe Afenifere for allegedly undermining peace, security and peaceful coexistence of the country.</p><p>Reacting in a statement on Monday, SNF’s spokesman, Olufemi Lawson, described the Northern group as a national security threat.</p><p>The group added that it would confront CNG if the Federal Government failed to call the group and its members to order.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49rZqysn6V6osDTmpqkoZ6cera%2FjK2mZp%2BRnrtuvM6loK2hk5a5brzOqaylmaKewbp5wKmaZp6Zp7K0ecmenppn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./70686-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pastor Ashimolowo's Son Spends Honeymoon With Wife In Dubai</span></a>

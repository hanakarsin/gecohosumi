Source: netflixThe teaser trailer for Season 3 of Stranger Things just dropped and fans are very, very excited. In the show's typical fashion a list of all the upcoming season's episode titles dropped, and there are a few in particular that have got people really excited.
Specifically the one that references &#34;Suzie.&#34; If you've watched the Netflix series, you'll know that there isn't a character that goes by that name in the series, and the only person I can think of is Susan Hargrove, Max's biological mother and Billy's step mom."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In the show's typical fashion a list of all the upcoming season's episode titles dropped, and there are a few in particular that have got people really excited.</p><p>Specifically the one that references "Suzie." If you've watched the <a href=#>Netflix</a> series, you'll know that there isn't a character that goes by that name in the series, and the only person I can think of is Susan Hargrove, Max's biological mother and Billy's step mom.</p><p>If she is the "Suzie" in question, then that means she's probably going to play a much larger role in the upcoming season. Maybe even as large as a role as this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dustin Chia Pet</a> plays on my holiday wish list — one can only hope.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><p>The other episode name that's got people talking is "The Battle of Starcourt," — Starcourt, of course, being the show's Starcourt Mall. Since that one is last, we can assume that there's going to be a season-ending, battle spectacular free-for-all that takes place in the popular shopping destination. If that doesn't spell '80s awesomeness, then I don't know what does.</p><p>Here's the full list of episodes that were featured in the trailer:</p><li>Suzie, Do You Copy?</li><li>The Mall Rats</li><li>The Case of the Missing Lifeguard</li><li>The Sauna Test</li><li>The Source</li><li>The Birthday</li><li>The Bite</li><li>The Battle of Starcourt&nbsp;</li><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><p>The release date for Season 3 has yet to be determined, which means that we don't know when any of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">following popular fan theories</a> will turn out to be true or not:</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Hopper and Joyce are an item.</h2><p>It's pretty clear that towards the end of Season 1 and throughout Season 2 that there was a vibe growing between these two.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Hopper will be Eleven's "dad."</h2><p>She'll enroll in school as the new kid and Hopper will be her on-the-books father and caretaker. Not like he isn't already taking up those duties.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. The creepy Owls</h2><p>These freaky birds from the Upside Down will play a larger role, maybe even escaping from the monster dimension to hunt human beings, which could lead to a raise in deaths/murders in the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. The Cold War</h2><p>It's the '80s, after all. Maybe Eleven will use her powers to do well in school and beat up bullies, which might get kids spreading rumors that she's a Russian spy. Man, school is tough.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. More Monsters</h2><p>The Mind Flayer from Season 2 should continue to play a role in Season 3, but its presence is a premonition of the even more freaky monsters that will come to give the gang more grief.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. John Hughes</h2><p>Since the kiddos are growing up and entering high school, and this is the '80s, look for some throwback references to iconic '80s movies. Similar plot lines, or maybe even costumes, will pop up so if you're a sucker for nostalgic, totally awesome rom-coms, Season 3 might make you very, very happy.</p><p>What are your predictions for Season 3 of Stranger Things? Personally, I just wanna see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hopper do that dance all over again</a>.</p><p>Check out the full teaser trailer for the upcoming season below:</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZqal9mfXC%2FuGt4hHqgZMC1vsCnnp6qXam1qrrGrGSsnZGovK95kg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cbn-lifts-forex-restrictions-on-rice-cement-building-materials-toothpicks-others.html><span>←</span><span>CBN Lifts Forex Restrictions On Rice, Cement, Building Materials, Toothpicks, Others</span></a>

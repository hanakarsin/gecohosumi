And while you could pretty much tailgate anywhere you can park a car and bust out a cooler of drinks and a portable grill, the practice is often most closely associated with NFL fans who vehemently debate whether or not Tom Brady would be able to survive under the rule set that other greats like Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw among many others."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

His face: stoic, presumably fixated on the task at hand: to take as many $20 bills from unsuspecting NFL game attendees as possible.</p><p>A sign on the table reads: "$100 to your $20 I can chug a Friday beer faster than you change my mind."</p><p>An unsuspecting participant approaches Ronny at the table and puts $20 into his jar as he says, "Go Patriots."</p><p>The two men cheers and they begin to chug: Ronny's is gone in an instant as the challenger is still drinking from his own cup.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ronnydoitche</span></figure><p>He graciously accepts defeat as Ronny pats him on the shoulder while bystanders cheer, impressed by his ability to pound a beer as quickly as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardi B was ready to pounce on someone throwing her shade on Love and Hip Hop</a>.</p><p>Another NFL fan tries his luck and Ronny seemingly gives him a head start, but he summarily loses, earning Ronny another $20 in the process. The third guy puts up a better fight, but ultimately falls to Ronny.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ronnydoitche</span></figure><p>While the video shows a fourth competitor, someone off camera remarks that Ronny was already "10 beers deep" at this point, signifying he's already managed to earn $200 from his tailgating venture. This individual watches the chug champ best him, and doesn't even bother to attempt to chug any longer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ronnydoitche</span></figure><p>No matter who steps up to test their mettle against Ronny, they can't seem to match his speed, but everyone, to their credit, takes it well. By the end of it, according to a caption he appended to his post, he was $440 richer, which, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">depending on the tickets he bought for the game</a>, should more than cover the cost of his ticket and the beers he brought to the parking lot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ronnydoitche</span></figure><p>TikTokers who bore witness to Ronny's chugging excellence seemed just as impressed as everyone else watching on in the video. Like this person who wrote: "It seemed like he just kept getting faster each time lol I could never do that"</p><p>While another was just impressed with his hustle: "Dudes making money by drinking beer. I need this talent lol"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6quMaaq56qXZm%2FqrrKoqWgZZKasrN5xaipZqyZmLimwNI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./679025-read-top-13-shocking-prophecies-coming-year-buhari-biafra-boko-haram-html.html><span>←</span><span>Primate Ayodele Unveils His Predictions For 2016</span></a>

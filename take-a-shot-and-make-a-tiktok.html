It seems like nearly every TikTok trend requires some special supplies or editing skills.</p><p>So, imagine our delight upon hearing about the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Take a shot and make a TikTok</u></a>” trend. If you’re wondering what it is, all you have to do is read the name of it, then follow the directions. If that’s still not quite clear enough for you, we’ll explain a bit more. (By the way, the TikTok sound associated with this trend has some NSFW language, just so you’re aware!)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jessa.galvan href=#>@jessa.galvan</a><p>Took us a few tries😂 <a title=takeashot href=#>##takeashot</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a></p><a title="♬ Take a Shot and Make a TikTok - Nategawd & Flo Rida & Lil Jon" href=#>♬ Take a Shot and Make a TikTok - Nategawd & Flo Rida & Lil Jon</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The directions are pretty clear: Take a shot and make a TikTok.</h2><p>It looks like this TikTok trend is centered around one particular TikTok sound called, appropriately enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Take a Shot and Make a TikTok</u></a>” by Nategawd, Flo Rida, and Lil Jon. The concept is pretty simple: You’re supposed to take a shot (of alcohol, in case that wasn’t obvious), and then make a TikTok video. Easy enough.</p><p>After scrolling through the many, many TikTok videos that use that particular song, it seems as though the concept has evolved (slightly). Many of the videos feature a group of people taking shots one at a time. Either the people stand in a line and take their shot before moving out of the way, or people line the shots up in a line. It’s not, like, fine art, but for people who are looking for a way to consume alcohol in some kind of “fun” way, this trend provides exactly that.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@nyafebres href=#>@nyafebres</a><p>Fourth of July pregame @ewright42599</p><a title="♬ Take a Shot and Make a TikTok - Nategawd & Flo Rida & Lil Jon" href=#>♬ Take a Shot and Make a TikTok - Nategawd & Flo Rida & Lil Jon</a></figure><p>Another twist on the trend involves using the <a href=#><u>Face Zoom effect</u></a>. People will stand in a group with their back to the camera, then turn around together. Whoever is chosen by the Face Zoom effect has to take a shot. It’s truly a modern drinking game, huh? Who knew we’d end up using technology in such a way? (Just kidding — it was inevitable.)</p><p>Obviously, if you’re going to participate in this trend, please do so responsibly and don’t break any laws. Plus, it’s not like you have to drink alcohol to be a part of the trend. Take a shot of lemonade! Or water! It’s important to stay hydrated, you know?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Obviously, this isn’t the first drinking game to go viral on TikTok.</h2><p>This probably goes without saying, but if you’re looking for a new drinking game, you can find plenty of them on TikTok. One that got super popular over the summer was known as the Basketball challenge. This one is best done outside!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chapparrittaatm href=#>@chapparrittaatm</a><p><a title=epicfail😂😂 href=#>##EPICFAIL😂😂</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>##foryoupage</a> <a title=for href=#>##for</a> <a title=you href=#>##you</a> <a title=page href=#>##page</a> <a title=basketballchallenge href=#>##basketballchallenge</a> <a title=basketballsmirnoff href=#>##basketballsmirnoff</a> <a title=drinkinggame href=#>##drinkinggame</a> <a title=turnup href=#>##turnup</a> @kendrarodriguez63</p><a title="♬ Drink - Dirty - Lil Jon" href=#>♬ Drink - Dirty - Lil Jon</a></figure><p>Place a bottle of your beverage of choice on top of a basketball, then drop the basketball to the ground. When it bounces, your drink will fly into the air (hooray, physics!). You’re supposed to catch it and then take a drink. Honestly, this one requires a bit too much hand-eye coordination if you ask us, but feel free to give it a try if it strikes your fancy.</p><p>Once again, please use your best judgment and enjoy these challenges responsibly. Just keep it in mind next time you’re looking to have a bit of extra fun, TikTok can be a good resource for activities — both when you’re drinking and when you’re not!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6ssYyaZKygn6l6orrDZqSao5Virm7AyKSrqKM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./no-condemnation-in-christ-sammie-okposo-returns-to-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>'No Condemnation In Christ' - Sammie Okposo Returns To Instagram</span></a>

So how to manage it has been challenging to us. We are even trying to think of some solutions. If you observed, for those who were here when the matter came up, but of course, the roads were free because the matter was shifted to late afternoon.</p><p>“What will ultimately happen is that, we are exploring the possibility of shifting the venue of the trial. That will be the best way out, otherwise, if the trial continues here, it will interfere with our business. We have 11 courts here but it is only one court that is trying Kanu.</p><p>“And anytime the case comes up, the other courts cannot function. It is really not a good development. But I can assure you that we have actually gone far in finding a solution to it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BxZq2doqe8s7XSpmScoJGntKa%2FjJ%2BcnZ2ilrlutMign2abn6q%2FtXnTqGSsoJmbwW7CxKesnmWfm3qvusCmm6Jlm5a7tr%2BMramimZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./details-of-adamus-meeting-with-apc-senators-emerge.html><span>←</span><span>Details Of Adamu's Meeting With APC Senators Emerge</span></a>

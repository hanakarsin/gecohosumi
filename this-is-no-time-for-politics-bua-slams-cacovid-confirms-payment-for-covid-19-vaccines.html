It is time for us to come together to help Nigerians and it does not matter who is helping or paying.</p><p>“We stand ready to keep supporting and despite this petty action, we have decided to let the money remain in the CACOVID Account with the CBN pending when they are ready to utilize the funds for Nigerians to access the vaccines,” the statement reads.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bua-CACOVID.jpg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Meanwhile, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>reported 643 new cases</a></strong> of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nigeria.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the new cases were reported in a post on the disease control agency’s Twitter handle on Monday night, February 8, 2021.</p><p>The newly reported cases bring the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria to 140,391 which includes 114,635 discharged cases and 1,673 deaths.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49yZq2gmah6qr%2BMp6ZmrJmism6yzqtkqaecnsGqr9Jmma6ZXai5ornSZpqam5%2BrtqV5wqiln6GiosBuvMCypJ6mpGKzsL6MnKavoZRifnp51ZqanKGemsBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1554622-lady-relocated-canada-2022-graduates-university-good-job-buys-big-car-html.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;Success Abroad&amp;quot;: Lady Relocates to Canada, Graduates From School, Gets Good Job and Buys 2 Cars</span></a>

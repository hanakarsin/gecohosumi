Carey</strong> filed the motion dated Monday, October 23, 2023, to stop the two federal agencies from releasing some confidential information to the public.</p><p>Tinubu’s lawyer informed the court that the defendants, the FBI and IRS, didn’t have his interests in mind because the documents requested by the plaintiff, Greenspan, included the President’s private documents, some of which are protected by the law.</p><p>Specifically, Tinubu pleaded that he would be “adversely affected” should the U.S. Court for the Northern District of Columbia in Washington D.C. deny his motion to intervene in the matter.</p><p>“Mr Tinubu should be allowed to intervene because he has a direct interest in the records sought, his interests are not fully represented or protected by defendants, and his interests will be adversely affected if he is not permitted to intervene,” Carey said.</p><p>The lawyer also asked the court for a 30-day period to review all the files to ensure that his client’s private and legally protected documents were not disclosed.</p><p>Tinubu’s move came weeks after he lost a fierce battle to block a federal court in Chicago from releasing his academic records to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_8639.jpeg alt width=1242 height=1047 sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_8640.jpeg alt width=1462 height=1124 sizes="(max-width: 1462px) 100vw, 1462px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_8641.jpeg alt width=1490 height=952 sizes="(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5FsZq2hnqqvtnnFoqOeq12ivLW1zqdkraddqMGwvIyfmaJlmafAbrLRqKRmqpWhsqK%2FyKeeZpufo7OqsMSnq6KZnGKzqrjErGSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./701104-breaking-lassa-fever-hits-17-states-html.html><span>←</span><span>JUST IN: Lassa Fever Hits 17 States</span></a>

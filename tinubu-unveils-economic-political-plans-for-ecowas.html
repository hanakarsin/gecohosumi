There is no governance, freedom and rule of law without Democracy. We will not accept coup after coup in West Africa again. Democracy is very difficult to manage but it is the best form of government.</p><p>“There is no one here among us who did not campaign to be a leader. We didn’t give our soldiers resources. We didn’t invest in them, in their boots, in their training to violate the freedom of the people.</p><p>“To turn their guns against civil authorities is a violation of the principles upon which they were hired which is to defend the sovereignty of their nations. We must not sit in ECOWAS as toothless bulldogs.</p><p>“You will all agree with me that democracy and good governance are the cornerstones of peace and sustainable development of every society. I’m fully committed to deepening democracy and good governance in the region.</p><p>“We must strengthen our democratic institutions and ensure the respect for human rights and the rule of law. I will enhance engagements with the countries in transition to ensure their quick return to democratic rule.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BpZq2hnqqvtnnUp62eoZyoeqavzqempqGTYr2wuMitoJyZnGK9ra3NrGSfp6JisqS71pqqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./namiko-browner-html.html><span>←</span><span>Namiko Love Browner - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

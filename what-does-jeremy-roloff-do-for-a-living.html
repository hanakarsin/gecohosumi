Source: Instagram/@audreyroloffFans of Little People, Big World were pretty bummed when Jeremy and Audrey Roloff decided to leave the TLC series in 2018. The couple was a fan favorite, after all, and they had only just begun their journey as parents; viewers wanted more. Not to mention, Jeremy and Audrey were turning down a sizable paycheck from TLC."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Ever since Jeremy and Audrey left 'Little People, Big World' for good, fans have wondered.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@audreyroloff</span></figure><p>Fans of <a href=#>Little People, Big World</a> were pretty bummed when <a href=#>Jeremy and Audrey Roloff</a> decided to leave the TLC series in 2018. The couple was a fan favorite, after all, and they had only just begun their journey as parents; viewers wanted more. Not to mention, Jeremy and Audrey were turning down a sizable paycheck from TLC. This loss of income has caused viewers to wonder: What does Jeremy Roloff do for a living?</p><p>These days, Jeremy and Audrey are busier than ever. Not only are they juggling a number of projects that generate income for their family, but they recently <a href=#>welcomed their second child</a> — making them parents of two. Ember, 2, and their newborn son, Bode, definitely keep Jeremy and Audrey on their toes as they continue to pursue their business endeavors.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at what Jeremy Roloff does for a living since parting ways with Little People, Big World, shall we?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@audreyroloff</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Jeremy Roloff do for a living?</h2><p>A quick peek at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy's LinkedIn profile</a> reveals a significant shift happened in August 2019. That's when Jeremy stopped a number of his positions, including: camera operator, production assistant, wedding videographer, and producer.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also when he listed his current job title as president of The Roloff Company. Which makes sense, considering this is the umbrella company that now encompasses his and Audrey's business ventures during this post-reality-show chapter of their lives.</p><p>But what does he actually do?</p><p>For starters, Jeremy and Audrey sell a book they published in April 2019 called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Love Letter Life</a>, as well as an accompanying marriage journal on their website. They went on to publish a second book Creative Love, an anniversary journal titled Memories of Us, and a finance journal called Debt Free Journal.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Audrey Mirabella Roloff (@audreyroloff)</a></p></figure><p>They also had a podcast called Behind the Scenes, which they had been doing from November 2018 to March 2021. (This was also based on their relationship, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they had a blog</a> to go along with it.)</p><p>That's not all. Audrey often shares sponsored posts via Instagram — plus, she has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">separate Instagram account</a> where she promotes her essential oils. Fans can also buy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy's Lightroom presets package</a> to incorporate a hint of his expertise into their own photos. This branch of the Roloff family <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a weekly (and now a monthly) email newsletter</a> to which fans can subscribe.</p><p>It also looks like Jeremy and Audrey are planning to rent out a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cabin they purchased in the Bend. Ore</a>., when they and their family aren't hanging out there, that is.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Audrey Mirabella Roloff (@audreyroloff)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeremy Roloff is working on getting his private pilot license.</h2><p>In July 2021, Jeremy obtained his student pilot license, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. He is prohibited to carry passengers at this point in his aviation training, but the goal is to earn his private pilot license.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@jeremyroloff</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Jeremy Roloff's net worth?</h2><p>Jeremy's net worth isn't exactly a number he has shouted out to the world — but with a little digging, we can come up with a ballpark estimate. Although he's no longer part of Little People, Big World, Jeremy likely brought in roughly $120,000 per year for appearing on the show. (That figure is courtesy of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>, with which an agent in the business shared that reality TV stars make between $7,000 and $10,000 per episode.) So Jeremy amassed a decent income from that alone for years.</p><p>In a broader sense, though, CelebrityNetWorth.com estimates <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy's current net worth to be $700,000</a>. Which isn't too shabby — and proves he and Audrey are doing pretty well for themselves even after parting ways with TLC.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this profile on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Audrey Mirabella Roloff</a> (@<a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>audreyroloff</a>) • Instagram photos and videos</p></figure><p>Clearly, Jeremy and Audrey are still extremely busy even after deciding to end filming for Little People, Big World. And with three young children on top of all their ongoing projects, it's seriously impressive that they're able to get it all done. Way to hustle, Mom and Dad!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZ%2Bys7HMsmSrp5yks6d5w6hkn6eiYq5uuMivoKef</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-presidency-omokri-alleges-how-tinubu-is-using-peter-obi-against-atiku.html><span>←</span><span>Omokri Alleges How Tinubu Is Using Peter Obi Against Atiku</span></a>

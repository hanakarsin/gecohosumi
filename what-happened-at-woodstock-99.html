But what happened at Woodstock '99 to make it such a disaster?</p><p>Before Woodstock '99 was even planned, though, Woodstock '94 happened to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original festival. At that event, which also promised three days of music and fun for concert-goers, additional attendees were able to sneak in to the event, making for an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">350,000 people</a> at the festival, which was more than double the amount estimated from ticket sales.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Woodstock '99 was disappointing for many.</p></figure><p>Thousands of people were also treated for various medical reasons and there were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">three deaths</a> at the festival.</p><p>Woodstock '99 came with its own pitfalls, however, and it's the follow-up to the 1969 event that people still talk about today, rather than the 1994 event which was organized in the same vein.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened at Woodstock '99?</h2><p>There were many things that contributed to the overall failure of Woodstock '99. While the festival lasted the entire three days as planned, increasing outdoor temperatures, overpriced foods, and crowd restlessness and violence all added up to create a festival that wasn't the new three days of music and peace that festival attendees had hoped for when they purchased their tickets.</p><p>Which, by the way, were $150 for the weekend (around $266 by today's prices).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the funniest thing about woodstock 99 is all the people going wild for kid rock</p>— iana murray (@ianamurray) <a href=#>August 1, 2022</a></figure><p>The first issue was that Woodstock '99, while in upstate New York like the 1969 festival, took place on a former airstrip, so most of the areas on which to walk on and even set up tents for campers was hot asphalt. And the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">price of food and water</a> in the event were notoriously high.</p><p>Patrons had to shell out $4 for bottles of water or soda, equivalent to $7 today, $12 (or $21 in 2022) for 10 inch pizzas, and $5, or around $9 today, for hotdogs and sandwiches.</p><p>Then, there was the violence. After the festival, multiple cases of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual assault</a> were reported from festival attendees. Violence in the crowd was also reported during Limp Bizkit's set on-stage, during which frontman Fred Durst first told the crowd to "let the negative energy out," but then reminded them, "It's time to let yourself go right now."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Limp Bizkit at Woodstock '99.</p></figure><p>Bonfires were started after a an anti-gun violence group distributed candles meant to be burned during the Red Hot Chili Peppers' song "Under the Bridge." And when a tower caught on fire, the local fire department was called in to put it out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Netflix docuseries is all about the failed follow-up to the 1969 Woodstock festival.</h2><p>Netflix's Trainwreck: Woodstock '99 details what went wrong and why people still blame Fred Durst for part of the mayhem at the 1999 festival.</p><p>You can also learn more about it from various podcasts like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Crime Scene</a>, which has an episode titled "Woodstock '99," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Break Stuff: The Story of Woodstock '99</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Post Empire Podcast</a>, with an episode called "Rethinking Woodstock '99."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnArWSwp5%2BZwLW7wqRkcnE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-sings-netflix.html><span>←</span><span>'Miranda Sings Live' Colleen Ballinger's Netflix Special Explained</span></a>

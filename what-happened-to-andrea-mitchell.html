Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton in the "Black House Autonomous Zone" when an individual wearing a pink bra, underwear, stockings, and a wig rushed towards the two women.</p><p>The unidentified person briefly laid a hand on the democratic delegate’s back before being dragged away by a security guard. Seconds after the incident, Andrea could be heard saying, "Where are the police when you need them?" — an ironic response given that they were standing in what protesters have deemed a police-free zone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This guy tried to attack Andrea Mitchell just now. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oO459ciDvm</a></p>— Justin Hart (@justin_hart) <a href=#>June 23, 2020</a></figure><p>Andrea has been viewed as a polarizing figure in the past, issuing several apologies for comments she’s made on air. In 2008, for example, the MSNBC host called voters in southwest Virginia "rednecks."</p><p>"I owe an apology to the good people of Bristol, Va. for something stupid that I said last week," she acknowledged in an on-camera statement.</p><p>"I was trying to explain, based on reporting from Democratic strategists, why Barack Obama was campaigning in southwest Virginia, but without attribution or explanation, I used a term strategists often use to demean an entire community. No excuses, I'm really sorry."</p><p>A few years earlier, Andrea was forcibly removed from a room in Khartoum, Sudan by two armed security guards for directing pointed questions about the genocide in Darfur at then Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"It is our job to ask," the Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent said at the time. "They can always say 'no comment'... but to drag a reporter out just for asking is inexcusable behavior."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">The individual who rushed at Andrea could be a known D.C. scam artist.</h2><p>One Twitter user pointed out that the person seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">running towards Andrea</a> in the video looks like an individual who was accused in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit thread</a> two months ago of scamming hundreds of people.</p><p>"Wow this person tried to scam me last week!" one redditor wrote underneath a photo of the individual wearing a pink bra and blonde wig. "Quickly [began] pleading for money to get to a silver spring hostel. Said I had none and asked for my venmo name. At that point I said nope and continued on my way."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>A second commenter, who used she/her pronouns when referring to the unnamed individual, claimed, "Per NextDoor, this person is a notorious street scammer that pulls up to people and [aggressively] asks for money as 'help' to get somewhere…</p><p>"She brags about scamming 200-300 dollars from people on the street every day," the user continued. "If you don't have cash she will demand venmo, and by some accounts will even pull out a square swiper."</p><p>It remains unclear whether this individual is the same person who tried to accost Andrea Mitchell, but we hope they get the help they need.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSappSnsqJ5zKKrnKCVobk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sandy-koufax-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sandy Koufax - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>

The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion from the show</a> was later uploaded to YouTube, where the word had been removed.</p><p>So, what exactly did Whoopi say? We break it down below.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did Whoopi Goldberg say on 'The View'?</h2><p>During a March 15 episode of The View, the hosts began talking about <a href=#>former President Donald Trump's</a> hush money payment to <a href=#>Stormy Daniels</a>. In this discussion, Whoopi spoke about Trump supporters, referring to them as "people who still believe that he got (expletive) somehow in the election."</p><p>In the apology video, Whoopi claimed that "When you’re a certain age, you use words that you know from when you were a kid or you remember saying, and that’s what I did today. And I shouldn’t have."</p><p>She added: "I should have said ‘cheated,’ and I used another word and I’m really, really sorry."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A message from Whoopi Goldberg regarding today's episode of <a href=#>#TheView</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PIvwYRWMsy</a></p>— The View (@TheView) <a href=#>March 15, 2023</a></figure><p>The exact word Whoopi used was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"gypped"</a> (sometimes spelled "jipped"), which means to cheat or swindle. Many people don't know that the word is tied to "gypsy" and can be very offensive. Gypsies refer to the Romani people, who were often considered frauds and thieves. That said, using the word “gypped” is derogatory towards people with Romani heritage.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Whoopi Goldberg was suspended from 'The View' earlier this year after a misinformed Holocaust comment.</h2><p>During a Jan. 31 episode of The View, the hosts engaged in a discussion about a Tennessee school board's decision to ban the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, which is about World War II's Nazi death camps. Whoopi remarked that the Holocaust was "not about race" but rather about "man's inhumanity to other man," which caused a stir amongst the audience.</p><p>She explained her viewpoint on an appearance of Stephen Colbert's <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Late Show</strong></a> that night. "When you talk about being a racist, I was saying, you can't call this racism. This was evil. This wasn't based on the skin, you couldn't tell who was Jewish," she said.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>The following morning, she issued an apology on The View, noting that she misspoke and the Holocaust was "indeed about race." Although Whoopi had tried to rectify the situation, ABC News president Kim Godwin announced the decision to suspend her from the show for two weeks, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Whoopi returned to The View on Feb. 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIywpqucXZm2pXnWoaaoqJlitLC4w5ucq59dqK66</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sound-of-music-html.html><span>←</span><span>The Sound of Music - Cast, Ages, Trivia</span></a>

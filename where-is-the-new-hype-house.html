The TikTok star explained to his followers that the gang was "last-minute house shopping." Adding, "We need to find a new Hype House eventually cause our lease is almost up. We want to be able to find a bigger and better place."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Fans who regularly follow social media stars may recognize their new crib. The Hype House team now resides at the old Clout House, which is located in the Hollywood Hills.&nbsp;</p><p>This contemporary 10 bedroom and 13 bathroom mansion is approximately 12,500 ft., and full of open spaces for the group to film TikTok videos. The home is complete with a game room, theater, elevator, gym, pool, and multiple balconies.&nbsp;</p><p>On the group's official TikTok page, the Hype House showed off their new crib, giving followers a quick tour of their L.A. mansion.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thehypehouse href=#>@thehypehouse</a><p>New house tour @bangenergy @bangenergy.ceo</p><a title="♬ original sound - thehypehouse" href=#>♬ original sound - thehypehouse</a></figure><p>So, who is living at the Hype House? During the quick tour video, Alex Warren named the members who have rooms at the new place. The influencers who are currently living in the house are: Ondreaz and Tony Lopez, Nick Austin, Ryland Storms, Michael Sanzone, Thomas Petrou, Chase Hudson, Calvin Goldby and Patrick Huston (sharing a room), Alex and Kouvr Annon, and Tayler Holder and Nate Wyatt are residing in the guest house.&nbsp;</p><p>Alex also revealed that there are multiple guest bedrooms, so we're sure members such as Addison Rae and Avani Gregg will be posting up in the guest room when visiting for collab videos.</p><p>Since moving into the new house, their old residence has remained empty, which didn't stop people from breaking into it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A mother-daughter duo broke into the Hype House.</h2><p>Yikes. A mother-daughter duo and some friends <a href=#>decided to break into the old Hype House</a> and film themselves going through the articles of clothing and such that were left there, documenting their "trip" to the California home on social media.</p><p>Though the girls claimed they were let into the house by a "caretaker," the Hype House issued a statement claiming the individuals were "breaking and entering."</p><p>"Considering the fact that there simply is no 'caretaker' for the house, or anyone beyond the current Hype House residents (who weren't home at the time), that has the authority to breach security, open the security gate, and 'invite' strangers into our home, we have turned the full investigation over to law enforcement and will follow their lead regarding next steps and holding the appropriate individuals accountable for their actions," the statement read (via Insider).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The statement continued: "Regarding accountability, regardless of intent or lapses in judgement, breaking an entering, trespassing, and property theft are criminal offenses that will not be tolerated by the members of Hype House or law enforcement. From here, we'll defer to law enforcements and the legal system to determine the appropriate outcome for those involved."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlpJ2ybrrEsGShsaCaeqm71Kyc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./we-are-99-9-hopeful-of-supreme-court-victory-kano-apc-forum.html><span>←</span><span>We Are 99.9% Hopeful Of Supreme Court Victory Kano APC Forum</span></a>

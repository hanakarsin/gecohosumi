This time around, the mystery contestants have been sorted into three groups: The Good, The Bad, and The Cuddly.</p><p>There's no shortage of creativity when it comes to this season's costumes, either. Among the stunning characters on Team Good is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefly</a>, and The Masked Singer viewers already have some theories about what her true identity might be.

Like most clue packages/features on the show, hers was filled with plenty of fantastic puns. "The next superstar on Team Good is fired up and ready to glow," it began.</p><p>With her voice disguised, Firefly said, "I'm sure you've heard the buzz about me, but can you guess who I am? There's no way I'm going to flicker out of this competition. Everyone else is glowing down."</p><p>Up until the May 18 finale, Firefly's clues have included:</p><ul><li>A tiara</li><li>A program for a ‚ÄúLive Comedy‚Äù show at the Apollo Theater</li><li>A photo of Tyler Perry</li><li>The Statue of Liberty</li></ul><p>A "Mega Clue" also came in the form of a photo of Pharrell Williams, with Firefly saying, "Pharrell is one of the major keys in my career."</p><p>The final clue for Firefly came during the Season 7 recap episode, which aired on May 11: A skateboard.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Fox/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Firefly on 'The Masked Singer' ‚Äî The Guesses</h2><p>Up until the May 18 finale, our best guess was that Firefly is <a href=#>Teyana Taylor</a> because all of the clues simply lined up. Teyana was born in Harlem, which aligns with the Statue of Liberty clue. Plus, she appeared on Showtime at the Apollo in Harlem. The references to comedy ‚Äî like the program and the Tyler Perry photo ‚Äî make sense, too, because Teyana has appeared in a number of comedy movies, like Tyler Perry's Madea's Big Happy Family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The tiara featured in the clues could have something to do with Teyana's appearance on My Super Sweet 16 or her role in Coming 2 America. In her first clue package, Firefly used the word "fade," which could be referring to Teyana's Fade2Fit workout program or the fact that she danced in Kanye West's music video for "Fade."</p><p>Other guesses as to who Firefly could be included:</p><ul><li>Aisha Tyler (Jenny McCarthy's guess)</li><li>Monica (Jenny's other guess)</li><li>Alicia Keys (Ken Jeong's guess)</li><li>Gabrielle Union (another fan theory)</li></ul><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Firefly on 'The Masked Singer'?

Andrew had been accused of raping a woman named Virginia Giuffre as a teenager, and while he was stripped of his military titles in 2021, many people believe that the Royal Family did their best to cover up his wrongdoings.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>During the 1980s, the queen tried to stop Princess Diana's work in HIV advocacy, telling her to do something "more pleasant."

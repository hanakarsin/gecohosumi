The pay-per-view was the fifth time that the lightweight bout between the undefeated Khabib Nurmagomedov, who's the hottest commodity in mixed martial arts today, was supposed to scrap against Tony Ferguson. Each of the fighters have pulled out of their respective contests two times a piece due to a combination of injuries and weight cutting issues.</p><p>Which is why a lot of people weren't exactly "surprised" when news of the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the Dagestani fighter to be grounded in Russia (it's a "cursed" fight after all). There was no way he was getting in or out of the country at that point.</p><p>That didn't mean Dana White was giving up on the fight, though. It didn't matter that he couldn't find an athletic commission to sanction it, or that Khabib wasn't fighting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Dana ultimately forged ahead and enlisted lightweight standout, Justin Gaethje, to sign a bout with Tony and decided to stage the fight at the Tachi Palace Casino, which was a WEC hotspot back in the day that's located on a Native American reservation in California. That means it had its own athletic commission and didn't need to adhere to the laws set in place by the state of California.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: UFC 249 has been canceled.

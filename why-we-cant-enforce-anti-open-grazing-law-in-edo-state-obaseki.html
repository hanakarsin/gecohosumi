The best way of enforcing a law is to bring everybody together to be part of that law,” he said.</p><p>“We have a crisis in our country, it is deeply rooted; there are different causes. Let us go to the root of the causes and resolve it from there. People have said that we have lived a hundred years together in harmony before now. Why are we having these problems today?”</p><p>Speaking further, Obaseki said there is a need to understand why some individuals are using cattle herding to perpetrate crime in the state.</p><p>He pointed out that the anti-open grazing law is not a battle against Christians and Muslims, North and South or Edo and Fulani People.</p><p>Obaseki said: “If we don’t go to the reason, then we will be scratching the surface. Let us start by understanding why we are having this challenge. The anti-grazing law, in my view, is to deal with some perceptions. I want to tell you that this is not an issue between Christians and Muslims; it is not an issue between North and South, and it is not an issue between Edo and Fulani people.</p><p>“My worry is that if we don’t separate them so that we can know those people who are using cattle herding to perpetrate crime and insecurity in our state, we will be missing the point.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BrZrCgqWLEpnnCmqWtZZWjs7C%2Bwp5kmqaknnqwvMSnZKCqka%2B2r7OMpZiwZZmjeqawzmaqrZmkmnqwrsCsnKShXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gina-rhoc-boyfriend-travis.html><span>←</span><span>Who is RHOC star Gina Kirschenheiter's boyfriend, Travis?</span></a>

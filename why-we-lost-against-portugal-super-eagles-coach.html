But Emmanuel Dennis’ attempt to pull one back from the spot was blocked by the Portuguese goalkeeper, Rui Patricio.</p><p>Peseiro, however, said that the Eagles’ first-half performance was subpar when speaking to NFF TV after the match.</p><p>“Losing 4-0 was too much, we didn’t start well in the first half we didn’t show good organisation and we didn’t pressure the opponent. It’s true the opponent has too much quality but like I said the first half was not good but the second half was much better.</p><p>“I believe in the second half we showed we can so better, we missed a penalty and conceded two more goals. We must improve because we want to win the next AFCON,” he said.</p><p>Portugal played their last exhibition match against the Super eagles before travelling to Qatar for the World Cup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BxZrCgqWLEpnnLqKqtZZGcrqq60q1kqaeiqcKorctmqq6olad6pq3GpZysZZOkrqS0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-states-where-pdp-apc-dont-have-candidates-as-inec-publishes-full-list-of-governorship-candidates.html><span>←</span><span>States Where PDP, APC Don't Have Candidates As INEC Publishes Full List Of Governorship Candidates</span></a>

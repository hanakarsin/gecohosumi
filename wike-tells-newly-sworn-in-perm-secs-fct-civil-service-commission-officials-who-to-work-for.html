First of all, we want to thank His Excellency, the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, who has shown leadership by making sure the 2018 Act is being implemented. That again reassures us of the Renewed Hope Agenda.</p><p>“To the Permanent Secretaries, yes you have been made a permanent secretary, but you know what comes with it, you know the implication of that. If you perform below expectation, there is nothing like a query, there is nothing like querying you by the proper civil service rules, and we have no time for that. I don’t want to hear that files are unduly delayed.”</p><p>He added: “Please and please, we want you to support the government of Bola Ahmed Tinubu to realise the Renewed Hope Agenda. So, you owe Mr President to make sure that Abuja works, and it works very well. Wherever you are posted, what we require from you is commitment and total loyalty.”</p><p>The FCT Minister also announced plans to reshuffle the posting of directors, stating that he would implement it this afternoon.</p><p>“Immediately after now, the Head of Service will send out the postings of Directors. I have said that there will be total reshuffling in all areas, and I’m going to implement it this afternoon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BxZrChm5p6tbHLpapmppWsubp50rCmq6ZdnrtuvMSrpGarlZjAbrLCrWScoaaeuW6%2FxKutopuVYrCwucyiqqyhn6N6sLLFopqimZyoeri0zmarqGWnpL%2BsecWoqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1304657-what-boys-10-guys-girls-html.html><span>←</span><span>What boys want: 10 things guys like in girls</span></a>

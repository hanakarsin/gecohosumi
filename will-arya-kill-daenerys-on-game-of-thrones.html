Melisandre has already predicted as much, stating in back in Season 3 that Arya would close "brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes." Those brown eyes are believed to belong to Walder Frey, the blue to the Night King, and up until recently, fans were convinced that the green eyes belonged to Cersei Lannister.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>In the George R.R. Martin original novels, Daenerys had violet eyes, but in the show, she appears to have green eyes, which would fit in with the prophecy. It's worth noting that Melisandre told Varys he would die in Westeros, which came true last night.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>So with all that in mind, fans seem pretty convinced that it's going down next episode.

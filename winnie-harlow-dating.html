In 2019, her fans believed she was dating singer Maluma after they exchanged flirty comments on Instagram, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. Winnie also turned heads when she and Wiz Khalifa sparked romance rumors after the rapper posted a photo of them snuggled up on his account. Eventually, though, the couple parted ways in 2019.</p><p>After her split from Wiz, Winnie began dating Kyle Kuzma. In an interview with Stephen “Twitch” Boss on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>, she said the NBA star DM’d her a year before she responded. However, the pair became inseparable once they connected while quarantined due to the pandemic.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One month into the relationship, Winnie moved to L.A. to be closer to her newfound love, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers at the time. In July 2020, the supermodel reflected on the couple’s progress and new life together.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Happy birthday @kuz," Winnie captioned under a photo of her kissing Kyle. “Blessed to know your beautiful heart and soul. Endless hours of quarantine FaceTimes, and now I’m hooked. Thank you for helping me step out of my comfort zone, then making me comfortable outside of my comfort zone. Thank you for making me smile every day, wiping my tears, and pushing me to be my best. Thank you for your energy, king; it’s only up from here, lol. I love you, babe. Have an amazing day today, and kill it at work, young lion.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Winnie Harlow and Kyle Kuzma still in a relationship?</h2><p>Although they fell in love during L.A.’s lockdown, Winnie and Kyle called it quits temporarily. In August 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> first reported that the couple broke up after dating for over a year. Soon after the split, Kyle got traded from the Lakers to the Washington Wizards. It’s unclear if the trade affected his and Winnie’s romance.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During their reported time apart, the model continued working and sharing her adventures with fans as she typically does.

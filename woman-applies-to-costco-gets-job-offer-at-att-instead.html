With an average hourly rate of $18.96 per hour for its employees, comprehensive healthcare coverage even for part-time workers, along with a free membership and the ability to give out three additional ones to folks of their choosing, it's a pretty sweet deal for anyone looking to work a retail job."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They've got you covered. Foot-long prepared hot dogs with a fountain soda for less money than a king-sized Kit-Kat bar? Costco can do that for you.</p><p>You may have also noticed in your Costco travels that its stores usually feature kiosks from folks selling other products inside of the building that isn't directly affiliated with Costco.</p><p>Like the various cell phone providers that setup shop inside of a Costco.

Like what other reason would I get a job,"</p><p>Someone else said that they too have taken interviews in the past that were predicated on misleading promises: "i did a 'marketing assistant' interview a few months ago and turned out to be a pyramid scheme bruh i was sick"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @natiajoy</span></figure><p>Another person penned that the pyramid scheme struggle being a job seeker is a real one: "I remember the time I almost got tricked by a pyramid scheme too"</p><p>While someone else said that they noticed an inordinate number of these schemes while they were looking for remote jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic: "i hung up mid zoom interviews on so many scam 'marketing jobs' during lockdown"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @natiajoy</span></figure><p>One other commenter said that they were sick and tired of going on interviews that would put candidates through multiple interviews before finally telling them how much they'd be getting paid: "I had to sit through like 4 rounds before they finally told us the pay and what we'd really be doing. a big joke."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mmKmonJ6ytHnTqGScp6OpsLB5xp6rrGWapK9uu8WfnKtlkal6osDTZqCnq6SarqU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-jeremy-roloff-do-for-a-living.html><span>←</span><span>What Does Jeremy Roloff Do for a Living?

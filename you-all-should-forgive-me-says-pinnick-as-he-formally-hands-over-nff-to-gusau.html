Pinnick promised to as a member of the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>FIFA</strong></a> Council, continue to do his best in protecting the interest of Nigeria always.</p><p>NFF board members present at the handing over event include Yusuf Ahmed Fresh, Ms Aisha Falode, Rt. Hon. Essien Udofot and Sharif Rabiu Inuwa.</p><p>Others present include the General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, the Deputy General Secretary, Dr Emmanuel Ikpeme, and other members of Management and NFF Staff.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Pinnick received a standing ovation as he walked into the NFF Conference Room at the Sunday Dankaro House.</p><p>Pinnick in his address charged the Management and Staff to give Gusau and the new Board maximum support as they gave him and his team, and reiterated that he remained a part of the system and would still be available to offer advice and suggestions whenever such is sought.</p><p>He said: “I thank you for your loyalty and support in the past eight years, and the encouragement and support of the Board that I worked with.</p><p>“It was an awesome experience all through and I give God the glory. Football is the winner. I ask for the forgiveness of all those that I might have offended one way or the other, and I crave your support for the new team.</p><p>“The General Secretary is a formidable individual, a great administrator and a good man at heart. He is a man capable of stabilizing the new Board. I have no doubt that alongside other members of Management and Staff, they will propel Nigeria Football to new heights.</p><p>“As a FIFA Council Member, I am technically in charge of 22 countries including Nigeria. I will always do my best to protect and project the interests of Nigeria at all times. My administration gave its all and raised funds for the programs of the NFF and the National Teams, and built discipline within the National Teams. However, I see the new administration surpassing whatever we achieved. The new President is a strategist who is humble, dynamic and innovative.”</p><p>In his remark, the new NFF President lauded the historic occasion, saying the warm relationship between the old and the new guards is a reflection of the wonderful relationship that was forged among the members of the last board within eight years.</p><p>“We assure you, Pinnick, that we will always reach out to you for your advice and encouragement whenever the need arises,” Gusau said wishing the immediate NFF president the very best in his duties and tasks at FIFA and CAF.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BqZrKnpWKurbiMrJ%2BorZyZeqe70aCgr51dorJuv8CyqmaomaO7qq%2FKZpisZZiaeqe70aaYpaSpYrWiusOsZKiulad6r7LFZquoZZeqwKLBjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reno-omokri.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Reno Omokri On Naija News</span></a>
